997,"shall yet be glad for him, and he shall bless"
998,"on its windy site uplifting gabled roof and palisade,"
999,(if haply the dark will of fate

1011,from his lady's white hand caught;
1012,"in three distinguish’d parts, with three distinguish’d guides"
1013,"a orn'ment o' saciety, in my approprut spear:"
1014,"ef 'twarn't for studyin' evenins, why, i never 'd ha' ben here"
1015,"for ever, if that maiden sits enshrined"

1024,"what though the claret circled well,"
1025,the garrison-house stood watching on the gray rocks of cape ann;
1026,alas! their right to joy is plain.
1027,did all of them bow downward towards that side
1028,the bronze against the marble breast!

1042,"all passionate-sweet, as are the loving beams"
1043,"they still keep piping in their honey dreams,"
1044,"now betimes on a morning of summer that giuki's daughter arose,"
1045,"no, truly.--i will see her; tell my tale,"
1046,which 'mongst the wanton gods a foul reproach was held.

1049,where its first shadow casts the holy mountain;
1050,"might, looking up, see dian dip"
1051,no controversial hebraist was the dame;
1052,"will seek the half unjeweled tide,"
1053,or dying wail!

1058,"whose voices, hushed, have left our pathway lonely,"
1059,on us lift up the light
