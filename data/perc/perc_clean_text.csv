0,a tree beside the sandy river-beach 
1,    holds up its topmost boughs 
2,"like fingers towards the skies they cannot reach, "
3,"    earth-bound, heaven amorous. "
4,this is the soul of man. body and brain 
5,hungry for earth our heavenly flight detain. 
6,"o immense light and thou, o spirit-wide boundless space,"
7,"whom have you clasped and hid, deathless limbs, gloried face?"
8," vainly lie 'space and time, ""void are we, there is none."""
9,"vainly strive self and world crying, ""i, i alone."""
10," one is there, self of self, soul of space, fount of time,"
11,"heart of hearts, mind of minds, he alone sits, sublime."
12,"oh, no void absolute self-absorbed, splendid, mute,"
13,hands that clasp hold and red lips that kiss blow the flute.
14," all he loves, all he moves, all are his, all are he!"
15," many limbs sate his whims, hear his sweet ecstasy."
16,"two in one, two who know difference rich in sense,"
17,"two to clasp, one to be, this his strange mystery."
18,"in the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest,"
19,whose is the hand that has painted the glow?
20,"when the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether,"
21,who was it roused them and bade them to blow?
22,"he is lost in the heart, in the cavern of nature,"
23,he is found in the brain where he builds up the thought:
24,"in the pattern and bloom of the flowers he is woven,"
25,in the luminous net of the stars he is caught.
26,"in the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman,"
27,"in the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl;"
28,"the hand that sent jupiter spinning through heaven,"
29,spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.
30,these are his works and his veils and his shadows;
31,but where is he then? by what name is he known?
32,is he brahma or vishnu? a man or a woman?
33,bodied or bodiless? twin or alone?
34,"we have love for a boy who is dark and resplendent,"
35,"a woman is lord of us, naked and fierce."
36,"we have seen him a-muse on the snow of the mountains,"
37,we have watched him at work in the heart of the spheres.
38,we will tell the whole world of his ways and his cunning:
39,he has rapture of torture and passion and pain;
40,"he delights in our sorrow and drives us to weeping,"
41,then lures with his joy and his beauty again.
42,"all music is only the sound of his laughter,"
43,all beauty the smile of his passionate bliss;
44,"our lives are his heart-beats, our rapture the bridal"
45,"of radha and krishna, our love is their kiss."
46,"he is strength that is loud in the blare of the trumpets,"
47,and he rides in the car and he strikes in the spears;
48,he slays without stint and is full of compassion;
49,he wars for the world and its ultimate years.
50,"in the sweep of the worlds, in the surge of the ages,"
51,"ineffable, mighty, majestic and pure,"
52,beyond the last pinnacle seized by the thinker
53,he is throned in his seats that for ever endure.
54,"the master of man and his infinite lover,"
55,"he is close to our hearts, had we vision to see;"
56,"we are blind with our pride and the pomp of our passions,"
57,we are bound in our thoughts where we hold ourselves free.
58,"it is he in the sun who is ageless and deathless,"
59,and into the midnight his shadow is thrown;
60,"when darkness was blind and engulfed within darkness,"
61,he was seated within it immense and alone.
62,someone leaping from the rocks
63,past me ran with windblown
64,locks like a startled bright surmise
65,"visible to mortal eyes, —"
66,just a cheek of frightened rose
67,"that with sudden beauty glows,"
68,just a footstep like the wind
69,"and a hurried glance behind,"
70,"and then nothing, — as a thought"
71,escapes the mind ere it is caught.
72,someone of the heavenly rout
73,from behind the veil ran out.
74,the silver call
75,there is a godhead of unrealised things
76,to which time's splendid gains are hoarded dross;
77,"a cry seems near, a rustle of silver wings"
78,calling to heavenly joy by earthly loss.
79,all eye has seen and all the ear has heard
80,is a pale illusion by some greater voice
81,"and mightier vision; no sweet sound or word,"
82,no passion of hues that make the heart rejoice
83,can equal these diviner ecstasies.
84,a mind beyond our mind has sole the ken
85,"of those yet unimagined harmonies,"
86,the fate and privilege of unborn men.
87,"as rain-thrashed mire the marvel of the rose,"
88,earth waits that distant marvel to disclose.
89,"o thou of whom i am the instrument,"
90,"o secret spirit and nature housed in me,"
91,let all my mortal being now be blent
92,in thy still glory of divinity.
93,"i have given my mind to be dug thy channel mind,"
94,i have offered up my will to be thy will :
95,let nothing of myself be left behind
96,in our union mystic and unutterable.
97,my heart shall throb with the world-beats of thy 1ove;
98,my body become thy engine for earth-use;
99,in my nerves and veins thy rapture's streams shall move ;
100,my thoughts shall be hounds of light for thy power to loose.
101,keep only my soul to adore eternally
102,and meet thee in each form and soul of thee.
103,           at last i find a meaning of soul's birth
104,"           into this universe terrible and sweet,"
105,     i who have felt the hungry heart of earth
106,         aspiring beyond heaven to krishna's feet.
107,"     i have seen the beauty of immortal eyes,"
108,"        and heard the passion of the lover's flute,"
109,     and known a deathless ecstasy's surprise
110,       and sorrow in my heart for ever mute.
111,"    nearer apd nearer now the music draws,"
112,         life shudders with a strange felicity;
113,    all nature is a wide enamoured pause
114,"        hoping her lord to touch, to clasp, to be."
115,    for this one moment lived the ages past;
116,   the world now throbs fulfilled in me at last
117,the blue bird
118,i am the bird of god in his blue;
119,divinely high and clear
120,i sing the notes of the sweet and the true
121,for the god's and the seraph's ear.
122,i rise like a fire from the mortal's earth
123,into a griefless sky
124,and drop in the suffering soil of his birth
125,fire-seeds of ecstasy.
126,my pinions soar beyond time and space
127,into unfading light;
128,i bring the bliss of the eternal's face
129,and the boon of the spirit's sight.
130,i measure the worlds with my ruby eyes;
131,i have perched on wisdom's tree
132,thronged with the blossoms of paradise
133,by the streams of eternity.
134,nothing is hid from my burning heart;
135,my mind is shoreless and still;
136,"my song is rapture's mystic art,"
137,my flight immortal will.
138,bride of the fire
139,"bride of the fire, clasp me now close, -"
140,bride of the fire!
141,"i have shed the bloom of the earthly rose,"
142,i have slain desire.
143,"beauty of the light, surround my life, -"
144,beauty of the light!
145,"i have sacrificed longing and parted from grief,"
146,i can bear thy delight.
147,"image of ecstasy, thrill and enlace, -"
148,image of bliss!
149,"i would see only thy marvellous face,"
150,feel only thy kiss.
151,"voice of infinity, sound in my heart, -"
152,call of the one!
153,"stamp there thy radiance, never to part,"
154,o living sun.
155,a god's labour
156,i have gathered my dreams in a silver air
157,between the gold and the blue
158,"and wrapped them softly and left them there,"
159,my jewelled dreams of you.
160,i had hoped to build a rainbow bridge
161,marrying the soil to the sky
162,and sow in this dancing planet midge
163,the moods of infinity.
164,"but too bright were our heavens, too far away,"
165,too frail their ethereal stuff;
166,too splendid and sudden our light could not stay;
167,the roots were not deep enough.
168,he who would bring the heavens here
169,must descend himself into clay
170,and the burden of earthly nature bear
171,and tread the dolorous way.
172,coercing my godhead i have come down
173,"here on the sordid earth,"
174,"ignorant, labouring, human grown"
175,twixt the gates of death and birth.
176,i have been digging deep and long
177,mid a horror of filth and mire
178,"a bed for the golden river’s song,"
179,a home for the deathless fire.
180,i have laboured and suffered in matter’s night
181,to bring the fire to man;
182,but the hate of hell and human spite
183,are my meed since the world began.
184,"o word concealed in the upper fire,"
185,"thou who hast lingered through centuries,"
186,"descend from thy rapt white desire,"
187,plunging through gold eternities.
188,"into the gulfs of our nature leap,"
189,"voice of the spaces, call of the light!"
190,"break the seals of matter's sleep,"
191,break the trance of the unseen height.
192,"in the uncertain glow of human mind,"
193,"its waste of unharmonied thronging thoughts,"
194,carve thy epic mountain-lined
195,crowded with deep prophetic grots.
196,let thy hue-winged lyrics hover like birds
197,over the swirl of the heart's sea.
198,touch into sight with thy fire-words
199,the blind indwelling deity.
200,"o muse of the silence, the wideness make"
201,"in the unplumbed stillness that hears thy voice,"
202,in the vast mute heavens of the spirit awake
203,where thy eagles of power flame and rejoice.
204,"out, out with the mind and its candles flares,"
205,"light, light the suns that never die."
206,for my ear the cry of the seraph stars
207,and the forms of the gods for my naked eye!
208,let the little troubled life-god within
209,"cast his veils from the still soul,"
210,"his tiger-stripes of virtue and sin,"
211,his clamour and glamour and thole and dole;
212,with wind and the weather beating round me
213,     up to the hill and the moorland i go.
214,who will come with me? who will climb with me?
215,wade through the brook and tramp through the snow?
216,not in the petty circle of cities
217,cramped by your doors and your walls i dwell;
218,over me god is blue in the welkin
219,        against me the wind and the storm rebel.
220,"i sport with solitude here in my regions,"
221,               of misadventure have me a friend.
222,who would live largely?who would live freely?
223,                 here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.
224,"i am the lord of tempest and mountain,"
225,          i am the spirit of freedom and pride.
226,stark must he be and a kinsman to danger
227,    who shares my kingdom and walks at my side
228,the miracle of birth
229,i saw my soul a traveller through time; 
230,"    from life to life the cosmic ways it trod, "
231,"obscure in the depths and on the heights sublime, "
232,    evolving from the worm into the god. 
233,"a spark of the eternal fire, it came "
234,    to build a house in matter for the unborn. 
235,"the inconscient sunless night received the flame, "
236,    in the brute seed of things dumb and forlorn 
237,life stirred and thought outlined a gleaming shape 
238,"    till on the stark inanimate earth could move, "
239,born to somnambulist nature in her sleep 
240,    a thinking creature who can hope and love. 
241,"still by slow steps the miracle goes on, "
242,the immortal's gradual birth mid mire and stone. 
243,because thou art
244,"because thou art all-beauty and all-bliss, "
245,    my soul blind and enamoured yearns for thee; 
246,it bears thy mystic touch in all that is 
247,    and thrills with the burden of that ecstasy. 
248,behind all eyes i meet thy secret gaze 
249,    and in each voice i hear thy magic tune: 
250,thy sweetness haunts my heart through nature's ways 
251,    nowhere it beats now from thy snare immune. 
252,it loves thy body in all living things; 
253,    thy joy is there in every leaf and stone: 
254,the moments bring thee on their fiery wings; 
255,    sight's endless artistry is thou alone. 
256,time voyages with thee upon its prow  
257,and all the futures passionate hope is thou
258,the inner fields
259,there is a brighter ether than this blue
260,"pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,"
261,royaler investiture than this massed assault
262,of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.
263,immortal spaces of cerulean hue
264,are in our reach and fields without this fault
265,of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
266,in their deep murmur which white flowers strew
267,floating like stars upon a strip of sky.
268,this world behind is made of truer stuff
269,than the manufactured tissue of earth's grace.
270,there we can walk and see the gods go by
271,and sip from hebe's cup nectar enough
272,to make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face.
273,the golden light
274,thy golden light came down into my brain
275,and the grey rooms of mind sun-touched became
276,"a bright reply to wisdom's occult plane,"
277,a calm illumination and a flame.
278,"thy golden light came down into my throat,"
279,"and all my speech is now a tune divine,"
280,a paean-song of thee my single note;
281,my words are drunk with the immortal's wine.
282,thy golden light came down into my heart
283,smiting my life with thy eternity;
284,now has it grown a temple where thou art
285,and all its passions point towards only thee.
286,"thy golden light came down into my feet,"
287,my earth is now thy playfield and thy seat.
288,i passed into a lucent still abode
289,and saw as in a mirror crystalline
290,an ancient force ascending serpentine
291,the unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.
292,earth was a cradle for the arriving god
293,and man but a half-dark half-luminous sign
294,of the transition of the veiled divine
295,from matter's sleep and the tormented load
296,of ignorant life and death to the spirit's light.
297,"mind liberated swam light's ocean vast,"
298,and life escaped from its grey tortured line;
299,i saw matter illumining its parent night.
300,the soul could feel into infinity cast
301,timeless god-bliss the heart incarnadine.
302,"mother, i bow to thee!"
303,"rich with thy hurrying streams,"
304,"bright with thy orchard gleams,"
305,"cool with thy winds of delight,"
306,"dark fields waving, mother of might,"
307,glory of moonlight dreams
308,"over thy branches and lordly streams,"
309,"clad in thy blossoming trees,"
310,"mother, giver of ease,"
311,laughing low and sweet!
312,"mother, i kiss thy feet,"
313,speaker sweet and low!
314,"mother, to thee i bow."
315,"who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,"
316,when the swords flash out in twice seventy million hands
317,and seventy millions voices roar
318,thy dreadful name from shore to shore?
319,"with many strengths who art mighty and stored,"
320,"to thee i call, mother and lord!"
321,"thou who savest, arise and save!"
322,to her i cry who ever her foemen drave
323,back from plain and sea
324,and shook herself free.
325,"thou art wisdom, thou art law,"
326,"thou our heart, our soul, our breath,"
327,"thou the love divine, the awe"
328,in our hearts that conquers death.
329,"thine the strength that nerves the arm,"
330,"thine the beauty, thine the charm."
331,every image made divine
332,in our temples is but thine.
333,"thou art durga, lady and queen,"
334,"with her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,"
335,"thou art lakshmi lotus-throned,"
336,"pure and perfect without peer,"
337,"mother, lend thine ear."
338,"rich with thy hurrying streams,"
339,"bright with thy orchard gleams,"
340,"dark of hue, o candid-fair"
341,"in thy soul, with jewelled hair"
342,"and thy glorious smile divine,"
343,"loveliest of all earthly lands,"
344,showering wealth from well-stored hands!
345,"mother, mother mine!"
346,"mother sweet, i bow to thee,"
347,mother great and free.
348,the word of the silence
349,"a bare impersonal hush is now my mind,"
350,"a world of sight clear and inimitable,"
351,"a volume of silence by a godhead signed,"
352,"a greatness pure, virgin of will."
353,once on its pages ignorance could write
354,in a scribble of intellect the blind guess of time
355,"and cast gleam-messages of ephemeral light,"
356,a food for souls that wander on nature's rim.
357,but now i listen to a greater word
358,born from the mute unseen omniscient ray:
359,the voice that only silence' ear has heard
360,leaps missioned from an eternal glory of day.
361,all turns from a wideness and unbroken peace
362,to a tumult of joy in a sea of wide release.
363,the universal incarnation
364,"there is a wisdom like a brooding sun,"
365,"a bliss in the heart's crypt grown fiery white,"
366,"the heart of a world in which all hearts are one,"
367,a silence on the mountains of delight.
368,a calm that cradles fate upon its knees;
369,a wide compassion leans to embrace earth's pain;
370,"a witness dwells within our secrecies,"
371,the incarnate godhead in the body of man.
372,"our mind is a glimmering curtain of that ray,"
373,"our strength a parody of the immortal's power,"
374,our joy a dreamer on the eternal's way
375,hunting the fugitive beauty of an hour.
376,only on the heart's veiled door the word of flame
377,"is written, the secret and tremendous name."
378,the witness spirit
379,i dwell in the spirit's calm nothing can move
380,"and watch the actions of thy vast world-force,"
381,its mighty wings that through infinity move
382,and the time-gallopings of the deathless horse.
383,this mute stupendous energy that whirls
384,"the stars and nebulae in its long train,"
385,like a huge serpent through my being curls
386,with its diamond hood of joy and fangs of pain.
387,it rises from the dim inconscient deep
388,"upcoiling through the minds and hearts of men,"
389,then touches on some height of luminous sleep
390,the bliss and splendour of the eternal plane.
391,"all this i bear in me, untouched and still"
392,assenting to thy all-wise inscrutable will.
393,all is abolished but the mute alone.
394,"the mind from thought released, the heart from grief,"
395,grow inexistent now beyond belief;
396,"there is no i, no nature, known-unknown."
397,"the city, a shadow picture without tone,"
398,"floats, quivers unreal; forms without relief"
399,"flow, a cinema's vacant shapes; like a reef"
400,foundering in shoreless gulfs the world is done.
401,only the illimitable permanent
402,"is here. a peace stupendous, featureless, still."
403,"replaces all, - what once was i, in it "
404,a silent unnamed emptiness content
405,either to fade in the unknowable
406,or thrill with the luminous seas of the infinite.
407,the call of the impossible
408,our godhead calls us in unrealised things.
409,"asleep in the wide fields of destiny,"
410,a world guarded by silence' rustling wings
411,sheltered their fine impossibility.
412,"but part, but quiver the cerulean gates,"
413,close splendours look into our dreaming eyes;
414,we bear proud deities and magnificent fates;
415,faces and hands come near from paradise.
416,what shone thus far above is here in us;
417,bliss unattained our future's birthright is;
418,"beauty of our dim soul is amorous,"
419,we are the heirs of infinite widenesses.
420,"the impossible is the hint of what shall be,"
421,mortal the door to immortality.
422,"who was it that came to me in a boat made of dream-fire,"
423,with his flame brow and his sun-gold body?
424,"melted was the silence into a sweet secret murmur,"
425,"""do you come now? is the heart's fire ready?"""
426,"hidden in the recesses of the heart something shuddered,"
427,"it recalled all that the life's joy cherished,"
428,"imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,"
429,and the boat passed and the gold god vanished.
430,now within the hollowness of the world's breast inhabits - 
431,for the love died and the old joy ended - 
432,"void of a felicity that has fled, gone for ever,"
433,and the gold god and the dream boat come not.
434,i have wrapped the wide world in my wider self
435,and time and space my spirit's seeing are.
436,"i am the god and demon, ghost and elf,"
437,i am the wind's speed and the blazing star.
438,"all nature is the nursling of my care,"
439,i am its struggle and the eternal rest;
440,"the world's joy thrilling runs through me, i bear"
441,the sorrow of millions in my lonely breast.
442,"i have learned a close identity with all,"
443,yet am by nothing bound that i become;
444,carrying in me the universe's call
445,i mount to my imperishable home.
446,"i pass beyond time and life on measureless wings,"
447,yet still am one with born and unborn things.
448,the kingdom within
449,there is a kingdom of the spirit's ease.
450,"        it is not in this helpless swirl of thought,"
451,"        foam from the world-sea or spray-whisper caught,"
452,"with which we build mind's shifting symmetries,"
453,"nor in life's stuff of passionate unease,"
454,        nor the heart's unsure emotions frailty wrought
455,        nor trivial clipped sense-joys soon brought to nought
456,nor in this body's solid transiences.
457,wider behind than the vast universe
458,"        our spirit scans the drama and the stir,"
459,"a peace, a light, an ecstasy, a power"
460,waiting at the end of blindness and the curse
461,"        that veils it from its ignorant minister,"
462,the grandeur of its free eternal hour.
463,life and death
464,"life, death, - death, life; the words have led for ages"
465,our thought and consciousness and firmly seemed
466,two opposites; but now long-hidden pages
467,"are opened, liberating truths undreamed."
468,"life only is, or death is life disguised, -"
469,life a short death until by life we are surprised.
470,bride of the fire
471,"bride of the fire, clasp me now close, - "
472,bride of the fire!
473,"i have shed the bloom of the earthly rose,"
474,i have slain desire.
475,"beauty of the light, surround my life, - "
476,beauty of the light!
477,"i have sacrificed longing and parted from grief,"
478,i can bear thy delight.
479,"image of ecstasy, thrill and enlace, - "
480,image of bliss!
481,"i would see only thy marvellous face,"
482,feel only thy kiss.
483,"voice of infinity, sound in my heart, - "
484,call of the one!
485,"stamp there thy radiance, never to part,"
486,o living sun.
487,"silence is round me, wideness ineffable;"
488,white birds on the ocean diving and wandering;
489,"a soundless sea on a voiceless heaven,"
490,"azure on azure, is mutely gazing."
491,identified with silence and boundlessness
492,my spirit widens clasping the universe
493,"till all that seemed becomes the real,"
494,one in a mighty and single vastness.
495,"someone broods there nameless and bodiless,"
496,"conscious and lonely, deathless and infinite,"
497,"and, sole in a still eternal rapture,"
498,gathers all things to his heart for ever.
499,i have a hundred lives
500,i have a hundred lives before me yet
501,"to grasp thee in, o spirit ethereal,"
502,be sure i will with heart insatiate
503,pursue thee like a hunter through them all.
504,thou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way
505,and with awakened vision watch me come
506,smiling a little at errors past and lay 
507,"thy eager hand in mine, its proper home."
508,meanwhile made happy by thy happiness
509,"i shall approach thee in things and people dear, "
510,"and in thy spirit's motions half-possess,"
511,"loving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,"
512,until i lay my hands on thee indeed
513,"somewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed."
514,the unseen infinite
515,arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks
516,"i meet no end, for all is boundless he,"
517,"an absolute joy the wide-winged spirit seeks,"
518,"a might, a presence, an eternity."
519,in the inconscient dreadful dumb abyss
520,are heard the heart-beats of the infinite.
521,"the insensible midnight veils his trance of bliss,"
522,a fathomless sealed astonishment of light.
523,"in his ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,"
524,our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the one:
525,only the eyes of immortality dare
526,to look unblinded on that living sun.
527,"yet are our souls the immortal's selves within,"
528,comrades and powers and children of the unseen.
529,"mystic miracle, daughter of delight, "
530,"life, thou ecstasy,"
531,let the radius of thy flight
532,on thy wings thou bearest high
533,"glory and disdain,"
534,"godhead and mortality,"
535,ecstasy and pain.
536,take me in thy wild embrace 
537,without weak reserve
538,body dire and unveiled face;
539,"faint not, life, nor swerve."
540,"all thy bliss i would explore,"
541,all thy tyranny.
542,"cruel like the lion's roar,"
543,sweet like springtide be.
544,"like a titan i would take,"
545,"like a god enjoy,"
546,"like a man contend and make,"
547,revel like a boy.
548,"more i will not ask of thee,"
549,nor my fate would choose;
550,"king or conquered let me be,"
551,live or lose.
552,even in rags i am a god;
553,"fallen, i am divine;"
554,"high i triumph when down-trod,"
555,long i live when slain.
556,"thou who pervadest all the worlds below,"
557,"yet sitst above,"
558,"master of all who work and rule and know,"
559,servant of love!
560,thou who disdainest not the worm to be 
561,"nor even the clod,"
562,therefore we know by that humility
563,that thou art god.
564,i have thrown from me the whirling dance of mind
565,"and stand now in the spirit's silence free,"
566,"timeless and deathless beyond creature-kind,"
567,the centre of my own eternity.
568,i have escaped and the small self is dead;
569,"i am immortal, alone, ineffable;"
570,"i have gone out from the universe i made,"
571,and have grown nameless and immeasurable.
572,"my mind is hushed in a wide and endless light,"
573,"my heart a solitude of delight and peace,"
574,"my sense unsnared by touch and sound and sight,"
575,my body a point in white infinities.
576,i am the one being's sole immobile bliss:
577,"no one i am, i who am all that is."
578,soul in the ignorance
579,"soul in the ignorance, wake from its stupor."
580,"flake of the world-fire, spark of divinity,"
581,lift up thy mind and thy heart into glory.
582,"sun in the darkness, recover thy lustre."
583,"one, universal, ensphering creation,"
584,"wheeling no more with inconscient nature,"
585,"feel thyself god-born, know thyself deathless."
586,timeless return to thy immortal existence.
587,i sat behind the dance of danger's hooves
588,"in the shouting street that seemed a futurist's whim,"
589,"and suddenly felt, exceeding nature's grooves,"
590,"in me, enveloping me the body of him."
591,"above my head a mighty head was seen,"
592,a face with the calm of immortality
593,and an omnipotent gaze that held the scene
594,in the vast circle of its sovereignty.
595,his hair was mingled with the sun and breeze ;
596,the world was in his heart and he was i:
597,"i housed in me the everlasting's peace,"
598,the strength of one whose substance cannot die.
599,the moment passed and all was as before;
600,only that deathless memory i bore.
601,my breath runs in a subtle rhythmic stream;
602,it fills my members with a might divine:
603,i have drunk the infinite like a giant’s wine.
604,time is my drama or my pageant dream.
605,now are my illumined cells joy’s flaming scheme
606,and changed my thrilled and branching nerves to fine
607,channels of rapture opal and hyaline
608,for the influx of the unknown and the supreme.
609,"i am no more a vassal of flesh,"
610,a slave to nature and her leaden rule;
611,i am caught no more in the senses’ narrow mesh.
612,"my soul unhorizoned widens to measureless sight,"
613,"my body is god’s happy living tool,"
614,my spirit a vast sun of deathless light.
615,to weep because
616,to weep because a glorious sun has set
617,which the next morn shall gild the east again;
618,to mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
619,which by that force a double strength attain;
620,to shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
621,"joy could not be, to make a terror of death"
622,"who smiling beckons us to farther life,"
623,and is a bridge for the persistent breath;
624,despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
625,"of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears"
626,"as rend the heart, though meant for its relief, "
627,and all man's ghastly company of fears
628,are born of folly that believes the span
629,of life the limit of immortal man.
630,when in the heart of the valleys and hid by the roses
631,"the sweet love lies,"
632,has he wings to rise to his heavens or in the closes
633,lives and dies?
634,on the peaks of the radiant mountains if we should meet him
635,"proud and free,"
636,will he not frown on the valleys? would it befit him
637,chained to be?
638,"will you then speak of the one as a slave and a wanton,"
639,the other too bare?
640,but god is the only slave and the only monarch
641,it is god who is love and a boy and a slave for our passion
642,he was made to serve;
643,it is god who is free and proud and the limitless tyrant
644,our souls deserve.
645,the guest - sonnet
646,i have discovered my deep deathless being:
647,"masked by my front of mind, immense, serene"
648,"it meets the world with an immortal's seeing,"
649,a god-spectator of the human scene.
650,no pain and sorrow of the heart and flesh
651,can tread that pure and voiceless sanctuary.
652,"danger and fear, fate's hounds, slipping their leash"
653,"rend body and nerve, - the timeless spirit is free."
654,"awake, god's ray and witness in my breast,"
655,in the undying substance of my soul
656,"flamelike, inscrutable the almighty guest."
657,death nearer comes and destiny takes her toll;
658,he hears the blows that shatter nature's house:
659,"calm sits he, formidable, luminous."

663,"oh lord, what shall i say to you?"
664,"you have broken my dark slumber,"
665,and now i shall move on the path of light.
666,"i shall move, i shall move, i shall move."
667,"my flower, which was long neglected,"
668,you have threaded in your garland.
669,"the offerings of my mind,"
670,"which were soiled with dust,"
671,you have taken onto your lap.
672,"i exchange all i had, for i have received you."
673,to you alone i will listen.
674,"i will listen, i will listen, i will listen."
675,"oh unknown traveler, you come alone"
676,by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)
677,english version by gunther smith
678,"oh unknown traveler, you come alone."
679,at the end of night when the jasmine flower fell.
680,"seeing my door closed, you stood by the wayside."
681,"my eyes half closed in sleep, some things i could see, and some things i could not."
682,"then you went away at dawn, wet with the mist at the end of night, floating in the infinite void."
683,the jasmine creeper at my door still carries the message of your arrival.
684,"removing its drops of dew, it remains awake, ever waiting for you."
685,"if at that time, i had opened my door, and whispered a word in your ear that autumn midnight,"
686,"i would have floated aloft, and mingled myself in your melody."

689,english version by gunther smith
690,"on the path of the journey to effulgence,"
691,"all are invited today, hence, i call."
692,"the earth, swinging in the great universal swing, has become beautiful."
693,"today, there is no discrimination."
694,"come all together, forgetting rivalry, let us all jointly announce that we are one and will remain one."
695,all hearts are threaded in the same garland of gems. let us all sing the song in the same tune.
696,"there is no high or low, black or white. all are brothers in the world."
697,"pain or earnestness of one, is pain or earnestness of all."
698,"all hearts oscillate in the same swing, within the ocean of nectar, singing one song."
699,"full of love, arousing hope, speaking in the same tone?look ahead."
700,"extending love to both friend and foe, singing the song of pardon, let us go forward."
701,the violin of all human minds
702,by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)
703,english version by gunther smith
704,"the violin of all human minds is playing with one harmony today, and so is the scent of every heart."
705,"with your sweet appearance, you have descended on the earth, giving the same realization."
706,"do not break this garland of flowers, which is the entire wealth of my love."
707,come closer and still closer and closer;
708,and take away my everything.
709,"at dusk, at dawn i gaze upon your beauty"
710,by darshan singh
711,english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi
712,original language urdu
713,"at dusk, at dawn i gaze upon your beauty --"
714,a dazzling spectacle of rising moon and sun.
715,"so far, the wayfarers have not discovered your footprints:"
716,they stand staring at the stepstone of your door
717,your glance of abundant grace did not satisfy;
718,we with the seeing eye know a glance from a glance.
719,"saqi, they've just arrived and taken their seats;"
720,how is it that they've already gained intimacy?
721,some you inspire with the madness of prostration:
722,they cannot tell their heads from your door.
723,"saqi, whoever comes by even a tinge of awakening"
724,"we see sitting in your assembly, oblivious to this world."
725,men who are maddened by the thought of the goal
726,see not fellow travelers -- they are intent on the road.
727,"master, in what strange state your darshan lives:"
728,we always see his eyes moist with tears.
729,how did i ever think silence the language of love?
730,by darshan singh
731,english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi
732,original language urdu
733,how did i ever think silence the language of love?
734,what i thought would not come to light was in plain sight.
735,i hear my silence talked of in every lane;
736,the suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.
737,the beloved's regard was but a flash of light;
738,how innocent to think i'd found eternal bliss.
739,"these, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind"
740,and that handful of pitiful straws i'd called my nest.
741,"darshan, the glances i'd fancied voiced my love --"
742,even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing.
743,how should i tell of the feeling that reigns
744,by darshan singh
745,english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi
746,original language urdu
747,how should i tell of the feeling that reigns in the court of the friend?
748,"dancing light is my beloved's face, cup and carafe are ecstatic!"
749,every nook and cranny is effulgent with his light;
750,every mote and grain celebrates the beloved's face.
751,"on earth from end to end i see his beauty,"
752,in heaven after heaven i gaze upon my friend.
753,"seeker banished from the beatific vision, look through the eyes of your heart!"
754,how can you see the beloved's light with eyes of flesh and blood?
755,"man's sorrows i bore, this world i loved --"
756,my whole life i gave to the work of my friend.
757,"brushing past me, it stirred my heart and was gone:"
758,god! the morning breeze has learned to tease from my friend.
759,"let them try to imprison him in temple, mosque and church!"
760,the seeing eye finds the beloved's signs in every mote.
761,very near your heart are seekers of your vision;
762,those who look at the surface are exiled from the beloved's light.
763,what can i say of the grace he showers on me within?
764,"darshan, the moment i close my eyes, the beloved's light begins."
765, in what state was i
766,by darshan singh
767,english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi
768,original language urdu
769,"who knows, in what state was i when i met her eyes?"
770,"where, who was i? completely lost."
771,for you that sun and that moon are gaudy snares:
772,"beware, lest caught, your gaze rise no higher."
773,my love -- the paradise at my journey's end -- is annoyed.
774,why does every path seem so lonesome?
775,"impetuous tipplers, have regard for the goblets and cups!"
776,"as you journey through the world of hearts, step gently."
777,"my madness knows why, nightlong, desperate with sorrow,"
778,"i rush about with tearful eyes, embracing shadows."
779,"i follow no guide, no creed -- just an inkling of the way:"
780,a tug at my heart leads me forward.
781,"friends, we must not let the darkness enshroud us again!"
782,so many kissed the gallows before we saw this dawn.
783,"when beauty herself provokes a look, therein lies the thrill:"
784,"were she not so expectant, what would compel my eyes?"
785,"darshan, life is the confluence of reality and dream:"
786,in this union lies the exaltation of a human being.
787,wonder of wonders!
788,by darshan singh
789,english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi
790,original language urdu
791,wonder of wonders! what grace flows within the saqi's tavern!
792,the secrets of both worlds are an open book in his cup.
793,why do you seek in the temple? what will you find in the ka'aba?
794,"open your inner eye, look in the idol house of your heart."
795,"friends, by morning you'll find nothing here but ashes:"
796,"my heart also burns, with the same sorrow as the moth."
797,"the wine of truth the saqi keeps concealed in his eyes,"
798,whatever he pours in the cup deceives thirst.
799,who is aware of this wonder? without instruments
800,resounds a symphony in the chamber of the heart!
801,"saqi, is slaying my desire your kind of mercy?"
802,i hear endless ecstasy reigns in your tavern.
803,"in moments of quietude, i often begin to wonder:"
804,is a musician playing a melody within my joyful heart?
805,"in all your life, darshan, nowhere will you find"
806,a joy to rival the rapture of master's tavern.
807,"ah, come sit beside me"
808,by jiddu krishnamurti
809,"ah, come sit beside me by the sea, open and free."
810,i will tell thee of that inward calmness
811,as of the still deep;
812,of that inward freedom
813,as of the skies;
814,of that inward happiness
815,as of the dancing waters.
816,"and as now the moon makes a silent path on the dark sea,"
817,so beside me lies the clear path of pure understanding.
818,"the groaning sorrow is hid under a mocking smile,"
819,"the heart is heavy with the burden of corruptible love,"
820,the deceptions of the mind pervert thought.
821,"ah, come sit beside me"
822,open and free.
823,"as the even flow of clear sunlight,"
824,so shall thine understanding come to thee.
825,the burdensome fear of anxious waiting
826,shall go from thee as the waters recede before the rushing winds.
827,"ah, come sit beside me,"
828,thou shalt know of the understanding of true love.
829,"as the mind drives the blind clouds,"
830,so shall thy brutish prejudice be driven by clear thought.
831,the moon is in love with the sun
832,and the stars fill the skies with their laughter.
833,"oh, come sit beside me"
834,open and free.
835,i am all
836,by jiddu krishnamurti
837,"i am the blue firmament and the black cloud,"
838,"i am the waterfall and the sound thereof,"
839,"i am the graven image and the stone by the wayside,"
840,"i am the rose and the falling petals thereof,"
841,"i am the flower of the field and the sacred lotus,"
842,"i am the sanctified waters and the still pool,"
843,i am the tree that towereth among the mountains
844,"and the blade of grass in the peaceful lane,"
845,i am the tender spring leaf and the evergreen foliage.
846,"i am the barbarian and the sage,"
847,"i am the impious and the pious,"
848,"i am the ungodly and the godly,"
849,"i am the harlot and the virgin,"
850,"i am the liberated and the man of time,"
851,"i am the the indestructible and the destructible,"
852,i am the renunciation and the proud possessor.
853,i am all
854,few know me.
855,"i am neither this nor that,"
856,"i am neither detached nor attached,"
857,i am neither heaven nor hell -- few know me --
858,"i am neither philosophies nor creeds,"
859,i am neither the guru nor the disciple.
860,i contain all.
861,"i am clear as the mountain stream,"
862,simple as the new spring leaf.
863,happy are they
864,that meet with me.
865,i walked on a path through the jungle
866,by jiddu krishnamurti
867,i walked on a path through the jungle
868,"which an elephant had made,"
869,and about me lay a tangle of wilderness.
870,the voice of desolation fills the distant plain.
871,and the city is noisy with the bells of a tall temple.
872,"beyond the jungle are the great mountains,"
873,calm and clear.
874,in the fear of life
875,the temptation of sorrow is created.
876,"cut down the jungle -- not one mere tree,"
877,for truth is attained
878,by putting aside all that you have sown.
879,and now i walk with the elephant.
880,i have been a wanderer long (from the search)
881,by jiddu krishnamurti
882,i have been a wanderer long
883,in this world of transient things.
884,i have known the passing pleasures thereof.
885,as the rainbow is beautiful
886,"but soon vanishes into nothingness,"
887,"so have i known,"
888,"from the very foundation of the world,"
889,the passing away of all things
890,"beautiful, joyous and pleasurable."
891,"as the moon is full and serene,"
892,in the day of harvest
893,so am i
894,in the day of my liberation
895,simple as the tender leaf am i
896,for in me are many winters and many springs.
897,"as the dew drop is of the sea,"
898,so am i born
899,in the ocean of my liberation
900,as the mysterious river
901,"enters the open seas,"
902,so have i entered
903,into the world of liberation
904,this is the end i have known.
905,i have no name (from the song of life)
906,by jiddu krishnamurti
907,"i have no name,"
908,i am as the fresh breeze of the mountains.
909,i have no shelter;
910,i am as the wandering waters.
911,"i have no sanctuary, like the dark gods;"
912,nor am i in the shadow of deep temples.
913,i have no sacred books;
914,nor am i well-seasoned in tradition.
915,i am not in the incense
916,"mounting on the high altars,"
917,nor in the pomp of ceremonies.
918,"i am neither in the graven image,"
919,nor in the rich chant of a melodious voice.
920,"i am not bound by theories,"
921,nor corrupted by beliefs.
922,"i am not held in the bondage of religions,"
923,nor in the pious agony of their priests.
924,"i am not entrapped by philosophies,"
925,nor held in the power of their sects.
926,"i am neither low nor high,"
927,i am the worshipper and the worshipped.
928,i am free.
929,my song is the song of the river
930,"calling for the open seas,"
931,i am life.
932,"i have no name,"
933,i am as the fresh breeze of the mountains.
934,it smelt of new rains and of tender
935,shoots of plants- and its warmth was the warmth
936,of earth groping for roots… even my
937,"soul, i thought, must send its roots somewhere"
938,"and, i loved his body without shame,"
939,on winter evenings as cold winds
940,chuckled against the white window-panes.
941,"all round me are words, and words and words,"
942,"they grow on me like leaves, they never"
943,seem to stop their slow growing
944,"from within... but i tell my self, words"
945,"are a nuisance, beware of them, they"
946,"can be so many things, a"
947,"chasm where running feet must pause, to"
948,"look, a sea with paralyzing waves,"
949,"a blast of burning air or,"
950,a knife most willing to cut your best
951,"friend's throat... words are a nuisance, but."
952,"they grow on me like leaves ona tree,"
953,"they never seem to stop their coming,"
954,"from a silence, somewhere deep within... "
955,a losing battle
956,how can my love hold him when the other
957,flaunts a gaudy lust and is lioness
958,"to his beast? men are worthless, to trap them"
959,"use the cheapest bait of all, but never"
960,"love, which in a woman must mean tears"
961,and a silence in the blood. 
962,i don't know politics but i know the names
963,"of those in power, and can repeat them like"
964,"days of week, or names of months, beginning with nehru."
965,"i amindian, very brown, born inmalabar,"
966,"i speak three languages, write in"
967,"two, dream in one."
968,"don't write in english, they said, english is"
969,not your mother-tongue. why not leave
970,"me alone, critics, friends, visiting cousins,"
971,every one of you? why not let me speak in
972,"any language i like? the language i speak,"
973,"becomes mine, its distortions, its queernesses"
974,"all mine, mine alone."
975,"it is half english, halfindian, funny perhaps, but it is honest,"
976,"it is as human as i am human, don't"
977,"you see? it voices my joys, my longings, my"
978,"hopes, and it is useful to me as cawing"
979,"is to crows or roaring to the lions, it"
980,"is human speech, the speech of the mind that is"
981,"here and not there, a mind that sees and hears and"
982,"is aware. not the deaf, blind speech"
983,of trees in storm or of monsoon clouds or of rain or the
984,incoherent mutterings of the blazing
985,"funeral pyre. i was child, and later they"
986,"told me i grew, for i became tall, my limbs"
987,swelled and one or two places sprouted hair.
988,"wheni asked for love, not knowing what else to ask"
989,"for, he drew a youth of sixteen into the"
990,"bedroom and closed the door, he did not beat me"
991,but my sad woman-body felt so beaten.
992,the weight of my breasts and womb crushed me.
993,i shrank pitifully.
994,then … i wore a shirt and my
995,"brother's trousers, cut my hair short and ignored"
996,"my womanliness. dress in sarees, be girl"
997,"be wife, they said. be embroiderer, be cook,"
998,"be a quarreller with servants. fit in. oh,"
999,"belong, cried the categorizers. don't sit"
1000,on walls or peep in through our lace-draped windows.
1001,"be amy, or be kamala. or, better"
1002,"still, be madhavikutty. it is time to"
1003,"choose a name, a role. don't play pretending games."
1004,don't play at schizophrenia or be a
1005,nympho. don't cry embarrassingly loud when
1006,"jilted in love … i met a man, loved him. call"
1007,"him not by any name, he is every man"
1008,"who wants. a woman, just as i am every"
1009,woman who seeks love. in him . . . the hungry haste
1010,"of rivers, in me . . . the oceans' tireless"
1011,"waiting. who are you, i ask each and everyone,"
1012,"the answer is, it is i. anywhere and,"
1013,"everywhere, i see the one who calls himself i"
1014,"in this world, he is tightly packed like the"
1015,sword in its sheath. it is i who drink lonely
1016,"drinks at twelve, midnight, in hotels of strange towns,"
1017,"it is i who laugh, it is i who make love"
1018,"and then, feel shame, it is i who lie dying"
1019,"with a rattle in my throat. i am sinner,"
1020,i am saint. i am the beloved and the
1021,"betrayed. i have no joys that are not yours, no"
1022,aches which are not yours. i too call myself i. 
1023,at the dresser.
1024,pale fingers over mirror-fields
1025,that wheat brown hair.
1026,"falling as chaff in old mirrors,"
1027,the cities turn….
1028,of late i have begun to feel a hunger
1029,"to take in with greed, like a forest fire that"
1030,"consumes and with each killing gains a wilder,"
1031,"brighter charm, all that comes my way. bald child in"
1032,"open pram, you think i only look, and you"
1033,"too, slim lovers behind the tree and you, old"
1034,man with paper in your hand and sunlight in
1035,"your hair... my eyes lick at you like flames, my nerves"
1036,"consume ; and, when i finish with you, in the"
1037,"pram, near the tree and, on the park bench, i spit"
1038,"out small heaps of ash, nothing else. but in me"
1039,the sights and smells and sounds shall thrive and go on
1040,and on and on. in me shall sleep the baby
1041,that sat in prams and sleep and wake and smile its
1042,toothless smile. in me shall walk the lovers hand
1043,"in hand and in me, where else, the old shall sit"
1044,"and feel the touch of sun. in me, the street-lamps"
1045,"shall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the"
1046,"wedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured"
1047,"skirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,"
1048,and in me the dying mother with hopeful
1049,"eyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown"
1050,"and gone away to other towns, other arms."" "
1051,o what does the burning mouth
1052,"of sun, burning in today's,"
1053,"sky, remind me….oh, yes, his"
1054,"mouth, and….his limbs like pale and"
1055,carnivorous plants reaching
1056,"out for me, and the sad lie"
1057,of my unending lust.
1058,"where is room, excuse or even"
1059,"need for love, for, isn't each"
1060,embrace a complete thing a finished
1061,"jigsaw, when mouth on mouth, i lie,"
1062,ignoring my poor moody mind
1063,"while pleasure, with deliberate gaeity"
1064,trumpets harshly into the silence of
1065,the room… at noon
1066,i watch the sleek crows flying
1067,like poison on wings-and at
1068,"night, from behind the burdwan"
1069,"road, the corpse-bearers cry ‘bol,"
1070,"hari bol' , a strange lacing"
1071,"for moonless nights, while i walk"
1072,"the verandah sleepless, a"
1073,million questions awake in
1074,"me, and all about him, and"
1075,thing that i dare not yet in
1076,his presence call our love.
1077,"your body is my prison, krishna,"
1078,i cannot see beyond it.
1079,"your darkness blinds me,"
1080,your love words shut out the wise world's din.
1081,"until i found you,"
1082,"i wrote verse, drew pictures,"
1083,"and, went out with friends"
1084,"now that i love you,"
1085,curled like an old mongrel
1086,"my life lies, content,"
1087,my grandmother's house
1088,there is a house now far away where once
1089,"i received love……. that woman died,"
1090,"the house withdrew into silence, snakes moved"
1091,"among books, i was then too young"
1092,"to read, and my blood turned cold like the moon"
1093,how often i think of going
1094,"there, to peer through blind eyes of windows or"
1095,"just listen to the frozen air,"
1096,"or in wild despair, pick an armful of"
1097,darkness to bring it here to lie
1098,behind my bedroom door like a brooding
1099,"dog…you cannot believe, darling,"
1100,"can you, that i lived in such a house and"
1101,"was proud, and loved…. i who have lost"
1102,my way and beg now at strangers' doors to
1103,"receive love, at least in small change? "
1104,punishment in kindergarten
1105,today the world is a little more my own.
1106,no need to remember the pain
1107,"a blue-frocked woman caused, throwing"
1108,"words at me like pots and pans, to drain"
1109,that honey-coloured day of peace.
1110,"‘why don't you join the others, what"
1111,a peculiar child you are! '
1112,"on the lawn, in clusters, sat my"
1113,"sugarcane, they turned and laughed; "
1114,"children are funny things, they laugh"
1115,"in mirth at others' tears, i buried"
1116,my face in the sun-warmed hedge
1117,and smelt the flowers and the pain.
1118,"the words are muffled now, the laughing"
1119,faces only a blur. the years have
1120,"sped along, stopping briefly"
1121,at beloved halts and moving
1122,sadly on. my mind has found
1123,an adult peace. no need to remember
1124,that picnic day when i lay hidden
1125,"by a hedge, watching the steel-white sun"
1126,standing lonely in the sky. 
1127,this love older than i by myriad
1128,saddened centuries was once a prayer
1129,in his bones that made them grow in years of
1130,"adolescence to this favored height; yes,"
1131,it was my desire that made him male
1132,"and beautiful, so that when at last we"
1133,"met, to believe that once i knew not his"
1134,"form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness"
1135,of his lips was hard indeed. betray me?
1136,"yes, he can, but never physically"
1137,only with words that curl their limbs at
1138,touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
1139,"why care i for their quick sterile sting, while"
1140,my body's wisdom tells and tells again
1141,"that i shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace"
1142,and even death nowhere else but here in
1143,my betrayer's arms... 
1144,summer in calcutta
1145,what is this drink but
1146,"the april sun, squeezed"
1147,like an orange in
1148,my glass? i sip the
1149,"fire, i drink and drink"
1150,"again, i am drunk"
1151,"yes, but on the gold"
1152,"of suns, what noble"
1153,venom now flows through
1154,my veins and fills my
1155,mind with unhurried
1156,laughter? my worries
1157,doze. wee bubblesring
1158,"my glass, like a brides"
1159,"nervous smile, and meet"
1160,"my lips. dear, forgive"
1161,this moments lull in
1162,"wanting you, the blur"
1163,in memory. how
1164,brief the term of my
1165,"devotion, how brief"
1166,your reign when i with
1167,"glass in hand, drink, drink,"
1168,and drink again this
1169,juice of april suns. 
1170,the dance of the eunuchs
1171,"it was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came "
1172,"to dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals "
1173,"richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling "
1174,"jingling... beneath the fiery gulmohur, with "
1175,"long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and "
1176,"they dance, oh, they danced till they bled... there were green "
1177,"tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some "
1178,were dark and some were almost fair. their voices 
1179,"were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of "
1180,lovers dying and or children left unborn.... 
1181,some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts 
1182,"and wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. they "
1183,were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from 
1184,"funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness "
1185,were in each of them. even the crows were so 
1186,"silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; "
1187,all were watching these poor creatures' convulsions 
1188,"the sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning "
1189,"and rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in "
1190,attics and the urine of lizards and mice.... 
1191,"he talks, turning a sun-stained"
1192,"cheek to me, his mouth, a dark"
1193,"cavern, where stalactites of"
1194,"uneven teeth gleam, his right"
1195,"hand on my knee, while our minds"
1196,are willed to race towards love;
1197,"but, they only wander, tripping"
1198,idly over puddles of
1199,desire. .... .can this man with
1200,nimble finger-tips unleash
1201,nothing more alive than the
1202,skin's lazy hungers? who can
1203,help us who have lived so long
1204,"and have failed in love? the heart,"
1205,"an empty cistern, waiting"
1206,"through long hours, fills itself"
1207,with coiling snakes of silence. .....
1208,i am a freak. it's only
1209,"to save my face, i flaunt, at"
1210,"times, a grand, flamboyant lust. "
1211,the looking glass
1212,getting a man to love you is easy
1213,only be honest about your wants as
1214,woman. stand nude before the glass with him
1215,so that he sees himself the stronger one
1216,"and believes it so, and you so much more"
1217,"softer, younger, lovelier. admit your"
1218,admiration. notice the perfection
1219,"of his limbs, his eyes reddening under"
1220,"the shower, the shy walk across the bathroom floor,"
1221,"dropping towels, and the jerky way he"
1222,urinates. all the fond details that make
1223,"him male and your only man. gift him all,"
1224,"gift him what makes you woman, the scent of"
1225,"long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts,"
1226,"the warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your"
1227,"endless female hungers. oh yes, getting"
1228,"a man to love is easy, but living"
1229,without him afterwards may have to be
1230,faced. a living without life when you move
1231,"around, meeting strangers, with your eyes that"
1232,"gave up their search, with ears that hear only"
1233,his last voice calling out your name and your
1234,body which once under his touch had gleamed
1235,"like burnished brass, now drab and destitute. "
1236,"at sunset, on the river ban, krishna "
1237,loved her for the last time and left...
1238,"that night in her husband's arms, radha felt "
1239,"so dead that he asked, what is wrong, "
1240,"do you mind my kisses, love? and she said, "
1241,"no, not at all, but thought, what is "
1242,it to the corpse if the maggots nip? 
1243,the old playhouse
1244,"you planned to tame a swallow, to hold her"
1245,in the long summer of your love so that she would forget
1246,"not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but"
1247,"also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless"
1248,pathways of the sky. it was not to gather knowledge
1249,of yet another man that i came to you but to learn
1250,"what i was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every"
1251,lesson you gave was about yourself. you were pleased
1252,"with my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow"
1253,"convulsions. you dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured"
1254,"yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed"
1255,"my poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. you called me wife,"
1256,i was taught to break saccharine into your tea and
1257,to offer at the right moment the vitamins. cowering
1258,beneath your monstrous ego i ate the magic loaf and
1259,"became a dwarf. i lost my will and reason, to all your"
1260,questions i mumbled incoherent replies. the summer
1261,begins to pall. i remember the rudder breezes
1262,of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. your room is
1263,"always lit by artificial lights, your windows always"
1264,"shut. even the air-conditioner helps so little,"
1265,all pervasive is the male scent of your breath. the cut flowers
1266,in the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. there is
1267,"no more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old"
1268,playhouse with all its lights put out. the strong man's technique is
1269,"always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,"
1270,"for, love is narcissus at the water's edge, haunted"
1271,"by its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last"
1272,"an end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors"
1273,to shatter and the kind night to erase the water. 
1274,we left that old ungainly house
1275,"when my dog died there, after"
1276,"the burial, after the rose"
1277,"flowered twice, pulling it by its"
1278,"roots and carting it with our books,"
1279,clothes and chairs in a hurry.
1280,"we live in a new house now,"
1281,"and, the roofs do not leak, but, when"
1282,"it rains here, i see the rain drench"
1283,"that empty house, i hear it fall"
1284,"where my puppy now lies,"
1285,the stone age
1286,"fond husband, ancient settler in the mind, "
1287,"old fat spider, weaving webs of bewilderment, "
1288,"be kind. you turn me into a bird of stone, a granite "
1289,"dove, you build round me a shabby room, "
1290,and stroke my pitted face absent-mindedly while 
1291,"you read. with loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, "
1292,you stick a finger into my dreaming eye. and 
1293,"yet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink "
1294,"like white suns in the swell of my dravidian blood, "
1295,secretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. 
1296,"when you leave, i drive my blue battered car "
1297,along the bluer sea. i run up the forty 
1298,noisy steps to knock at another's door. 
1299,"though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, "
1300,they watch me come 
1301,"and go like rain. ask me, everybody, ask me "
1302,"what he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, "
1303,"a libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake "
1304,before it clasps my pubis. ask me why like 
1305,"a great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, "
1306,and sleeps. ask me why life is short and love is 
1307,"shorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price...."
1308,bereft of soul
1309,my body shall be bare.
1310,bereft of body
1311,my soul shall be bare.
1312,which would you rather have
1313,o kind sea?
1314,which is the more dead
1315,of the two?
1316,"i throw the bodies out,"
1317,i cannot stand their smell.
1318,only the souls may enter
1319,the vortex of sea.
1320,only the souls know how to sing
1321,at the vortex of the sea.
1322,"your body shall be dead,"
1323,"dead as driftwood, drifting"
1324,and drifting to the shore.
1325,"your body shall ride the tide,"
1326,"rider, slumped dead"
1327,on white war-house.
1328,your body shall bruise white
1329,"against the coral reefs,"
1330,your lonely body.
1331,"i tell you, sea,"
1332,"i have enough courage to die,"
1333,but not enough.
1334,not enough to disobey him
1335,who said: do not die
1336,and hurt me that certain way.
1337,how easy your duties are.
1338,"only roar a hungry roar,"
1339,"you swing and you swing,"
1340,"o sea, you play a child's game."
1341,i must pose.
1342,"i must pretend,"
1343,i must act the role
1344,"of happy woman,"
1345,i must keep the right distance
1346,between me and the low.
1347,and i must keep the right distance
1348,between me and the high.
1349,"o sea, i am fed up"
1350,i want to be simple
1351,i want to be loved
1352,"if love is not to be had,"
1353,"i want to be dead, just dead"
1354,"while i enter deeper,"
1355,with joy i discover
1356,the sea's hostile cold
1357,is after all skin-deep.
1358,the sea's inner chambers
1359,are all very warm.
1360,there must be a sun slumbering
1361,at the vortex of the sea.
1362,"o sea, i am happy swimming"
1363,"happy, happy, happy ..."
1364,the only movement i know well
1365,is certainly the swim.
1366,it comes naturally to me.
1367,i had a house a malabar
1368,and a pale-green pond.
1369,i did all my growing there
1370,in the bright summer months.
1371,"i swam about and floated,"
1372,and divided into the cold and green
1373,i lay speckled green and gold
1374,"in all the hours of the sun,"
1375,"my grandmother cried,"
1376,"darling, you must stop this bathing now."
1377,you are much too big to play
1378,naked in the pond.
1379,"yes, the only movement i really know"
1380,it comes naturally to me.
1381,the white man who offers
1382,"to help me forget,"
1383,the white man who offers
1384,"himself as a stiff drink,"
1385,"is for me,"
1386,"to tell the truth,"
1387,only a pale-green pond
1388,glimmering in the sun.
1389,in him i swim
1390,all broken with longing.
1391,in his robust blood i float
1392,drying off my tears.
1393,yet i never can forget
1394,the only man who hurts.
1395,the only one who seems to know
1396,the only way to hurt.
1397,holding you is easy
1398,"clutching at moving water,"
1399,"i tell you, sea,"
1400,"this is easy,"
1401,but to hold him for half a day
1402,was a difficult task.
1403,it required drinks
1404,to hold him down.
1405,to make him love.
1406,"but, when he did not love,"
1407,all i could do was to sob like a fool.
1408,"you generous cow,"
1409,you and i are big flops.
1410,we are too sentimental
1411,for our own
1412,lights are moving on the shore.
1413,but i shall not return.
1414,"sea, toss my body back"
1415,that he knew how to love.
1416,bereft of body
1417,my soul shall be free.
1418,take in my naked soul
1419,that he knew how to hurt.
1420,only the soul knows how to sing
1421,at the vortex of the sea. 
1422,the sunshine cat
1423,"they did this to her, the men who know her, the man"
1424,"she loved, who loved her not enough, being selfish"
1425,"and a coward, the husband who neither loved nor"
1426,"used her, but was a ruthless watcher, and the band"
1427,"of cynics she turned to, clinging to their chests where"
1428,"new hair sprouted like great-winged moths, burrowing her"
1429,face into their smells and their young lusts to forget
1430,"to forget, oh, to forget, and, they said, each of"
1431,"them, i do not love, i cannot love, it is not"
1432,"in my nature to love, but i can be kind to you."
1433,they let her slide from pegs of sanity into
1434,"a bed made soft with tears, and she lay there weeping,"
1435,"for sleep had lost its use. i shall build walls with tears,"
1436,"she said, walls to shut me in. her husband shut her"
1437,"in, every morning, locked her in a room of books"
1438,with a streak of sunshine lying near the door like
1439,"a yellow cat to keep her company, but soon"
1440,"winter came, and one day while locking her in, he"
1441,noticed that the cat of sunshine was only a
1442,"line, a half-thin line, and in the evening when"
1443,"he returned to take her out, she was a cold and"
1444,"half dead woman, now of no use at all to men. "
1445,the testing of the sirens
1446,"the night, dark-cloaked like a procuress, brought"
1447,"him to me, willing, light as a shadow,"
1448,speaking words of love
1449,in some tender language i do not know ...
1450,"with the crows came the morning, and my limbs"
1451,"warm of love, were once again so lonely..."
1452,"at my doorstep i saw a pock-marked face,"
1453,a friendly smile and
1454,"a rolleiflex. we will go for a drive,"
1455,he said. or go see the lakes. i have
1456,"washed my face with soap and water, brushed"
1457,my hair a dozen
1458,"times, draped myself in six yards of printed"
1459,"voile. ah... does it still show, my night of love?"
1460,"you look pale, he said. not pale, not really"
1461,pale. it's the lipstick's
1462,"anemia. out in the street, we heard"
1463,"the sirens go, and i paused in talk to"
1464,weave their wail with the sound of his mirthless
1465,"laughter. he said,"
1466,they are testing the sirens today. i am
1467,happy. he really was lavish with words.
1468,"i am happy, just being with you."
1469,"but you . . . you love another,"
1470,"i know, he said, perhaps a handsome man,"
1471,"a young and handsome man. not young,"
1472,"not handsome, i thought, just a filthy snob."
1473,"it's a one-sided love,"
1474,i said. what can i do for yoou? i smiled
1475,"a smile is such a detached thing, i wear"
1476,"it like a flower. near the lake, a pregnant"
1477,girl bared her dusky
1478,breasts and washed them sullenly. on the old
1479,"cannon-stand, crows bickered over a piece"
1480,of lizard-meat and the white sun was there
1481,and everywhere . . .
1482,"i want your photo, lying-down,"
1483,"nineteen-thirty-four guns, he said,"
1484,"against those rusty nineteen-thirty-four guns,"
1485,will you ? sure. just arrange my limbs and tell
1486,me when to smile. i
1487,"shut my eyes, but inside eye-lids, there was"
1488,"no more night, no more love, or peace, only"
1489,"the white, white sun burning, burning, burning..."
1490,"ah, why does love come to me like pain"
1491,again and again and again? 
1492,as the man and the woman in me
1493,english version by deben bhattacharya
1494,original language bengali
1495,as the man and the woman in me
1496,"unite in love,"
1497,the brilliance of beauty
1498,balanced on the bi-petalled
1499,lotus bloom in me
1500,dazzles my eyes.
1501,outshine the moon
1502,and the jewels
1503,glowing on the hoods of snakes.
1504,my skin and bone
1505,are turned to gold.
1506,"i am the reservoir of love,"
1507,alive as the waves.
1508,a single drop of water
1509,"has grown into a sea,"
1510,could i ever forget him
1511,english version by deben bhattacharya
1512,original language bengali
1513,could i ever forget him
1514,since i delivered my heart
1515,at his feet?
1516,his beauty enchants my eyes
1517,round the compass
1518,wherever i steer myself.
1519,"though all call him black,"
1520,he is not black.
1521,he is the glow of the moon--
1522,"the black moon,"
1523,and there is no other moon to equal him....
1524,he talks to me
1525,english version by deben bhattacharya
1526,original language bengali
1527,he talks to me
1528,but he would not let me see him.
1529,close to my hands
1530,but away from my reach.
1531,the sky and the earth
1532,circling round my error
1533,of not knowing me:
1534,who am i
1535,and who is he?
1536,how the days drag
1537,english version by deben bhattacharya
1538,original language bengali
1539,how the days drag
1540,before union with the man of my heart!
1541,round the hours
1542,of the day and night
1543,"as the rain-bird, chataka,"
1544,"watches the clouds,"
1545,i gaze at the black-moon
1546,hoping to surrender myself
1547,at his feet--in vain.
1548,flashing through the clouds
1549,and hiding in the clouds
1550,"never to be found again,"
1551,i saw his beauty
1552,flashing through my dreams
1553,and i lost krishna.
1554,the moon is encircled by moons
1555,english version by deben bhattacharya
1556,original language bengali
1557,the moon is encircled by moons.
1558,how can i hold it
1559,in my hands?
1560,"the unseizable moon,"
1561,glowing in the brilliance
1562,"of a million moons,"
1563,rocks my head
1564,in a lunar carnival....
1565,moon fruits adorn
1566,"the tree of the moon,"
1567,i try to see
1568,but my eyes cannot bear;
1569,the rays of beauty
1570,a breathless counsel
1571,curiosity will catch you dear for you are a writer and it is your license to startle 
1572,the world with a hundred thousand words instead of a dazzling smile or those
1573,occasional winks and i don’t want to probe for after all you are renouncing all the
1574,time and i don’t want to stop you racing against life but i have been there and i 
1575,have returned and i know what happens when it takes hold of a woman yes i

1583,sit back and feel my work is done for once you have known what pain is then you 
1584,shall know how to preserve the fringes of happiness i want you to be alone in the 
1585,ravenous world where you never know what happens next just so that you will 
1586,no longer find routine to be so despicable and amidst that pervading fuzziness
1587,you shall long for an anchor for all your dreams only realizing much later that 
1588,you are your safety you are your ultimate but till then you might screech and 
1589,scream but when you retain your temperament you will find that life will always 
1590,lie waiting like an hungry beast and at each turn you take i wish you learn the 
1591,greater horrors and now i confess darling i want you hurt because i want to
1592,watch you fight and fight and fight i want you to pull together those moonbeams 
1593,of hope i want you to throb precariously i want you to be living on the edge i 
1594,want you to learn the thousand one ways in which you can melt the boundaries
1595,of saturation called death and the emptiness of life and the fidgetiness of what
1596,might be called love i want you to lose i want you to win but some day i want you 
1597,to be free
1598,apologies for living on
1599,i am living on
1600,because providing apologies is easy
1601,i was making choices
1602,with insanely safe ideas of
1603,i was a helpless girl
1604,against the brutal world of
1605,i was craving for security
1606,the kind i had only known while
1607,i am locked away
1608,a terrified princess waiting
1609,i don’t dream or think
1610,i just remember and wince
1611,i ran away in the darkness
1612,nothing beaconed me more than the
1613,i ran into the arms of the ravishing night
1614,nothing pulled me back: not even the memories
1615,i ran until terror stopped my tracks
1616,"for, trembling i turned and saw that the moon was"
1617,the next morning in school during your
1618,english exam you take permission to go to
1619,the toilet where you throw up all the white
1620,and creamy breakfast milk. only it tastes
1621,sour and looks like bits of maggoty curd.
1622,"weeks later, you get to know two things"
1623,one of which will change your life for ever.
1624,"first, you scored the highest in the english"
1625,"exam. second, you became a gossip item."
1626,you still don’t know what affects you more.
1627,because of your boldness and brashness
1628,and bunking classes your ulcerated vomit
1629,is taken for morning sickness. the sourness
1630,extends when you hear hushed whispers
1631,"passing around. girls younger than you,"
1632,point at you and speak such banal secrets.
1633,"in staff-rooms, and in ungainly corridors"
1634,"teachers chatter of your child, so vividly"
1635,imagined in the backdrop of your really
1636,empty womb. slander is a slaughterhouse.
1637,even best-friends seek answers as the
1638,rumours inflame. your anger is mistaken
1639,to be toward a crude imagined lover who
1640,disowned you. you know the nauseous
1641,truth of your thighs: you are virgin. but
1642,"evidence will not be revenge, for, so many"
1643,"smoky eyes implore you to supplicate, to"
1644,admit alleged truths. impeaching faces lay
1645,"down rules: don’t shout or scream, but"
1646,"swallow the shame. next, confess the sin."
1647,sin yes they will shred your innocent life to
1648,that yes you may fume or froth or boil or
1649,simmer yes you are their staple soup they
1650,need you just this way yes your fury takes
1651,its toll annihilating you not them yes anger
1652,and hatred seethe in your untamed tresses
1653,yes you know how gossip chokes even the
1654,tethered dreams yes something breaks in
1655,you yes dear yes you start the brute search
1656,for sleeping pills and chaste suicide ideas.
1657,at that brief time
1658,when you wait
1659,for the audacious cane
1660,"to strike your skin,"
1661,and the rest of you is flinching
1662,"and cringing, with part shame,"
1663,"and part pain,"
1664,poetry dictates itself
1665,in your mind. short lines
1666,"rip through, like bullets"
1667,from a machine gun.
1668,the poem comes with the
1669,"freshness of a life set free,"
1670,"whistling its way,"
1671,"painfully, like wind searing"
1672,through the palm fronds.
1673,the cane thrashes
1674,"your skin, dancing cruelly"
1675,and bouncing in wooden joy.
1676,"before you scream,"
1677,"or shake, the poetry stops."
1678,"and the muse, is tentatively,"
1679,"laid to rest, much before the"
1680,an angel meeting me
1681,and may be we will
1682,almost fall in love. . .
1683,"i will look into his eyes,"
1684,and he into mine—
1685,"my one single eye,"
1686,(the unfortunate other
1687,blinded by a disciplinizing slap)
1688,"and we will agree, adjust"
1689,that love can be blind.
1690,"and he, healthy boy"
1691,"well-fed, white with his rosy cheeks,"
1692,"will wonder about me,"
1693,"pity my bony body, those thin ribs"
1694,and feel my twisted ears
1695,"and the scars on my hands,"
1696,(reminders of the flirtation
1697,of my skin and a cruel cane)
1698,and perhaps lift my skirt. . .
1699,"before he learns the greater horrors,"
1700,i owe him the truth of me—
1701,"so, i will say to him:"
1702,“i went to school”.
1703,when memory decides
1704,to no longer bear the burdens—
1705,"of pain, or even plain indifference"
1706,she has her winsome wicked ways.
1707,"some day, years later,"
1708,life requires you to unearth
1709,some event long past and you
1710,set about browsing your brain
1711,like a desk-full of office files and then—
1712,come across a resounding emptiness.
1713,are not to be found. what
1714,"greets you instead, through"
1715,those yellowing sheets of typed matter is
1716,the blank and ugly blotches of dried whitener
1717,"so carefully applied, then. it has a fading smell of"
1718,"chalk and chlorine: a blend, like memory, that works at"
1719,your throat. you try to scratch it and the faintest hopes are
1720,"betrayed as the caked pieces of the whitener crumble,"
1721,"displaying nothing, but toe curling holes where crummy paper and ink once contained you."
1722,sage in the cubicle
1723,"even your tongue,"
1724,craves for the taste of tears. . .
1725,and you are crying again.
1726,misery is (you always believe) the only genuine
1727,"emotion and sadness, the way of the real world."
1728,she wouldn’t have any of it.
1729,"sage in the cubicle, healer of sorts."
1730,three years your junior. she makes soul-talk
1731,sound as prosaic as aeronautical engineering.
1732,"at the end,"
1733,‘stop this right now.’
1734,what will you say of your feeling
1735,living with a sister who terrorizes
1736,even manic depressions out of your mind?
1737,songs of summer
1738,"“i am happy, life is good.”"
1739, heard at the end of a therapy class. . .
1740, the heavy-duty brainwashing and you
1741, remember your crores stacked away. . .
1742, your harvard airs helps in large doses
1743," soon, the colors peel away and there is nothing"
1744, to do than wrestle with your yearnings.
1745,“i would like to make love.”
1746, wanna fuck? it is easier saying it this way
1747, for something that you paid for in cash
1748, and cheques and credit cards.
1749," forget the lesser action, the lack of poetry—"
1750, what mattered was how you let go
1751, of your hate and heat and hunger
1752, but never had the courage to talk
1753, to her of love or loneliness. . .
1754,“you are trespassing on my territory”
1755, you guarded it with locs and walls
1756, and barbed wire fences where hatred
1757, danced like high-voltage electricity. . .
1758, you killed creatures and cleared forests
1759, and wiped away the darker people
1760, and those of dreamy tongues with
1761," your agenda of a war-a-week, the"
1762, worlds-to-win and vengeance-to-wreak. . .
1763, your mushroom clouds and wmds and
1764, poverty drafts and armchair chivalry and
1765, a collective manhood of nuclear warheads
1766, that explode and penetrate. . .
1767," to make her yours and yours alone,"
1768, you pushed her deeper into harems
1769, where she could see the sunlight
1770, only from the lattice windows.
1771, domesticated into drudgery she was just
1772," another territory, worn out by wars. a slave"
1773, who maintained your numbers.
1774,“let’s make love.”
1775, ~all that you thought~
1776, what’s taking her so long to undress?
1777, quick! sooner!
1778, ~all that you said~
1779, i m gonna fuck till ya faint. . .
1780,“oh how nice to have made love.”
1781, ~breathless~ iminahurry. cyasoon.~panting~
1782,"here are the words, again—"
1783,i am happy. life is good / i would love to make love.
1784,you are trespassing on my territory/ she’s mine.
1785,let’s make love/ oh how nice to have made love.
1786,on sunny green fields these are the only
1787,six sentences the male of a grasshopper can ever say.
1788,but what have we done with words?
1789,marijuana murdered him
1790,a gray rainy day—
1791,on a road less traveled the patrol tracked down much:
1792,"him (him is now an it, a crumpled cruel corpse for women"
1793,to beat their breasts about); the wreckage (four black wheels
1794,that speak of despair and a mangled red car-body awash yet
1795,soiled and the cold apparitions of smoked glass and steel);
1796,the crime record—
1797,he stole at home he found no work he pimped his sis he
1798,mortgaged his mom he raped a girl (the myth reads so: like
1799,a crow calling its kindred he invited the last of his friends to
1800,"join the feast, the fest, yes the plunder between her thighs)"
1801,he stabbed his professor dad he lived on air and alcohol
1802,and insulin and morphine—but it was the marijuana that
1803,murdered him as he screamed at the vengeful rain that
1804,"teased away his nirvana, the excuse of an existence. . ."
1805,no pair of exacting eyes to see the trees drive into a rage into
1806,his car that once swallowed whole black roads but for the
1807,god on his dashboard temple who had since returned to
1808,"formlessness, to a hundred and eight tiny crystals that held"
1809,psychedelic rainbows that outshone all the trapped sun. . .
1810,why do the heroes die?
1811,"unlike in fairy tales, young heroes die."
1812,"all the dazzling princes, strong men of might,"
1813,robinhoods and messiahs that never lie
1814,"are done to death, evil winning the fight."
1815,heroes are bled; not just deprived of life
1816,"god turns in his throne, the dead in cold graves"
1817,and perhaps death ends the lifetimes of strife.
1818,is slaughter the prize for not being slaves?
1819,"brave men encounter blows, fight their case,"
1820,leave forsaking the world they came to mend.
1821,‘youth may arise and fill this vacant space’
1822,one faint hope; heroes reach the destined end.
1823,heroes get their halos. applause. praise.
1824,all glories shine brighter with sacrifice. 
1825,"work is worship, or so they said. . ."
1826,six thirty in the a.m.
1827,and you still have not
1828,gone to bed.
1829,it is three days
1830,since you have
1831,combed your hair.
1832,it is a week
1833,since you had a bath.
1834,and six weeks
1835,since your dog had hers.
1836,it is three months
1837,since you popped
1838,the baby pink multi-vitamins.
1839,it is half a year
1840,since you met your only best friend.
1841,woe to your scraggyscornfullistless world
1842,where the moonlit sky exists only in the grand
1843,lullabies that one of your grandmothers sang.
1844,meeting the prophetess
1845,leave your books behind.
1846,"like knowledge, is a traitor,"
1847,erase every hoarding of your horrible past.
1848,"at last, when you enter her world"
1849,of fraying edges and falling angels
1850,don’t barter words where touch will do and be the truth.
1851,"for once allow her silence to sear, strip your life-layers"
1852,because she who knows the truth will not know the tale.
1853,the flight of birds
1854,“a poem should be wordless
1855,as the flight of birds.”
1856,"—archibald macleish, ars poetica."
1857,birds don’t sing in their flight
1858,for them flying is a muse
1859,they compose mid-air
1860,weave agnostic verse
1861,sneering haughtily at our absurdity
1862,as they float over our meaningless mosques and churches
1863,and those patrolled international borders
1864,and other disputed sites
1865,where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
1866,they swing over there losing their birdegos
1867,(ego is difficult to retain in mid-flight)
1868,wondering about and watching men plucking out
1869,and quashing the lives of other men and women and
1870,poor helpless children and they
1871,shed a birdtear or two from there
1872,a birdtear that is lost midway due to heat of some explosion
1873,down below some crazy fanatical bomb detonating
1874,killing instantly the people and the city and the forests
1875,and even the pitiable babybirds who are yet to learn to fly
1876,they contemplate of writing poems
1877,about a bird’s egg charring
1878,before even being boiled and scratch their beaks
1879,unsure if this is a metaphor or simile or other poetic device
1880,o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about
1881,o their writings will never be banned
1882,they borrow freedom
1883,to write poems in the sky
1884,they come back and
1885,pass it on to us
1886,we take the song only
1887,but at least we take the song
1888,to take the poem
1889,to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again
1890,as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song
1891,to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us
1892,and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity
1893,perhaps we need to fly
1894,a trifle aimlessly like birds
1895,or because we are humans
1896,six-sensed creatures with massive egos
1897,and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
1898,and because of possessing gray matter
1899,what doctors call medulla oblongata
1900,we need to feel with our red hearts
1901,than think with some unlocatable mind
1902,we need to look deeper. . .
1903,"into ourselves, into eyes"
1904,we need to lose ourselves
1905,"then, and only then"
1906,the poems will come
1907,as the flight of birds
1908,s          p          a          c          e
1909,is a problem unlike your never-ending
1910,paper or the maddening blankness of
1911,your word processor where you can go on
1912,and on in anguish or insanity or boredom
1913,on one-hundred-and-seven degree fahrenheit afternoons.
1914,(to write the next lines you need to take
1915,the green&goldbrown duster to rub off these eight)
1916,colour is another confusion you want
1917,to wish away. at sixteen you wouldn’t write
1918,onesingleword unless it was forty percent
1919,gray letters on a plum background and your
1920,monitor looked like a high class youknowwho.
1921,"the font then was footlight mt light, 13 pt."
1922,"now, at twenty one, it is verdana, eight point."
1923,(i have erased again)
1924,nothing seduces like your own handwriting.
1925,the white chalk dancing across glass green.
1926,"creepers on w’s & r’s, hats on s, hearts on i’s & j’s."
1927,(i have erased again)
1928,i don’t grudge the colours too. instead of two hundred
1929,and fifty six fantasies there is the catholic bridal white.
1930,"sometimes, there is yellow, blue, green, purple, red and"
1931,orange and the opportunity of giving them names—
1932,flaky fullmoon. bleached & faded captain haddock suit.
1933,temple-tank algae. crushed lilac under flashlight.
1934,sherbet stain. sawdust chillidust cream.
1935,(i have erased again)
1936,there is considerable exertion (let me hazard a guess:
1937,"writing takes two hundred calories per hour, erasing"
1938,"with the duster five hundred, and walking across must"
1939,"be say, around eighty). then, there is chalk-dust allergy"
1940,that compels me to sneeze. and the chemical after-effect
1941,that spoils the moody brown skin of any glowing goddess.
1942,and the unbearable sounds
1943,of chalk squeak. . .
1944,(i have erased again.
1945,the fifth time now.)
1946,"but, a poet loves"
1947,writing blackboard poems.
1948,"(so easy, to imagine, an audience)"
1949,"yet, how much she dreads"
1950,impermanence. . .
1951,and you see the two-crows-for-joy-pass that are sitting on
1952,"overhead cables and the evening moon,"
1953,a mere silvery slice against fluffy translucent sky.
1954,and the remains of your school where you spent your twelve
1955,longest years and lived through everything.
1956,and the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow
1957,ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the
1958,place where a tiny café once stood.
1959,and the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk
1960,back home. and i thought of my parents.
1961,brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of
1962,morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddear-
1963,departed parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.
1964,"(and you are their child,"
1965,so you speak their lines.)
1966,"still returning home,"
1967,and there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like
1968,the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.
1969,and girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip
1970,gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into
1971,and the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises
1972,and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.
1973,and the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight
1974,and sound and smell and touch yes touch.
1975,and i thought of my lover.
1976,a primitive man who would invade
1977,your aloneness on insomniac nights
1978,and challenge your assumptions of
1979,love and your sophistications and fill
1980,your ears with the four letter words of
1981,his ancient language that have begun
1982,to sound to you like earth songs to
1983,which your body awakens.
1984,"(and you are his love,"
1985,so you listen to his lines.)
1986,"on the way home, the small"
1987,lessons you learn of life. . .
1988,"love, or the promise of love,"
1989,its lack of choice.
1990,this large world.
1991,and its littleness.
1992,and dusty grey
1993,the sky begins to blush.
1994,some sleepy careless charm welcomes
1995,and pink gold hues
1996,the smug sky at twilight
1997,a final flush of fulfilment
1998,how they prostitute a poem
1999,it is uniquely easy
2000,for some to sell
2001,business of absent
2002,goods is essentially
2003,a sacrosanct but mostly
2004,a flimsy transaction.
2005,"some learn, early on,"
2006,to prostitute their verse.
2007,"so, in all the waking hours"
2008,they scavenge for a simple simile
2009,"that matches requirements, fulfills needs."
2010,they barter reality
2011,and every romance
2012,to a blurred triplicate
2013,carbon-copy world of hard
2014,cash and price tags and brand names.
2015,in this brothel
2016,of stilled hope and
2017,"stagnated stories, poems"
2018,are born virgin and endowed
2019,"with voluptuous figures of firm,"
2020,full breasts and wide hips where men
2021,"prefer to plant their pastime dreams,"
2022,"or conceive their seed,"
2023,"or merely spite themselves,"
2024,or dabble at domination.
2025,"but, the poem, with this"
2026,bogus existence becomes
2027,"an adept, untiring prostitute."
2028,"on a starry night,"
2029,the poem opens
2030,(dry and drab and dreary:
2031,lacking love and life) like
2032,the paid-for parting
2033,of the thighs.
2034,sun in the mouth
2035,and the truth scorches and singes
2036,the pink open flesh of your mouth
2037,"with its pungent yellow taste, so,"
2038,speaking the truth is not so easy
2039,"with just one tongue, anyway."
2040,seeing might have been closest
2041,to truth and as plotinus said
2042,the eye would not be able to see
2043,the sun if it was itself not sun
2044,and so seeing was understanding.
2045,the egyptians called the eye
2046,with the circle of the iris
2047,with the pupil in the centre
2048,as the sun in the mouth
2049,and that was their truth.
2050,cyclops must have had little
2051,to see in this vast world and
2052,deprived of the whole truth
2053,"and that was his loss, his tragedy."
2054,even argus with all his eyes
2055,couldn’t escape in the end.
2056,"how much truth, how many eyes"
2057,of how many senses would it take
2058,to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?
2059,a king of a tamil temple city
2060,raged mad to know the truth
2061,of the scent of a woman’s hair.
2062,since money bought truth
2063,"he made ready, a thousand gold coins."
2064,and a poor poet still married to faith
2065,"prayed on to shiva, the lord of struggling"
2066,"survivors, lord of births and lives and"
2067,"deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him"
2068,a poem to be sung at the king’s court.
2069,a savant there picked a mistake like
2070,peeling the scab of a healed wound
2071,and said that the poem was wrong.
2072,he said that any woman’s hair
2073,did not have a natural scent.
2074,the lord of dances and grey ash
2075,and cremation grounds came down
2076,to challenge this stubborn man who
2077,"extended his truth, even if the woman"
2078,was the consort of the lord.
2079,he would not budge even if the lord
2080,"threatened to open his third eye,"
2081,the eye in the forehead which would
2082,reduce him to bone-white ashes
2083,as light as the wispiest clouds.
2084,the court cowered in fright. . .
2085,but in arrogance the savant said
2086,a mistake is a mistake
2087,even if it was the lord
2088,of the forehead-eye.
2089,o’ saint-bard and master of many wily words
2090,"what do you know of truth or love,"
2091,or the scent of a woman’s hair?
2092,on the nights of naked sky and
2093,"a fragile quarter moon, my lord,"
2094,"he of the deep blue throat,"
2095,"he of the rivers in his hair,"
2096,"he of the third-eye, comes to me."
2097,before he tears the blankness
2098,"of my womb, before he traces"
2099,"the length of my spine, the curve"
2100,"of my thighs, before he strokes"
2101,"my cheeks, he buries his head"
2102,in the thousand and one nights
2103,of my long tresses and he says
2104,it smells like the wind-lost voices
2105,of his childhood summers.
2106,justice is .
2107,the first lesson we are taught about life
2108,has something to do with dharma and karma.
2109,“dharma”. “karma” two good appetizing
2110,and rhyming words they may come in handy for classic poets.
2111,"dharma they say is indefinable,"
2112,it is all encompassing
2113,and yet untranslatable.
2114,dharma they say means
2115,"justice, integrity, veracity,"
2116,righteousness and legitimacy.
2117,almost enough meaning for a word.
2118,and you carry it on with yourself.
2119,dharma makes a versatile lucky-charm.
2120,"all your life, you blame things you don’t understand"
2121,on the word no one has ever understood.
2122,sometimes highly frustrated with the cruelty
2123,"and apathy of everything, you even resort to blaming karma"
2124,"and you begin to trace past lives, ancestry"
2125,you bother about the enormity of trivialities
2126,you start worrying about the petty lineage of everything
2127,you happen to come across.
2128,this insanity deludes you as you fret and fume over
2129,descent—pedigree—wretched caste—and above all proper
2130,marriages and the legitimate sons
2131,and then it all comes to you
2132,"the truth, the truth about all this ****"
2133,the truth about dharma
2134,"you remember the man,"
2135,"the man dharma,"
2136,for—the medium is the message.
2137,"you realize he is a bastard,"
2138,an illegitimate son.
2139,justice is dharma.
2140,dharma is a bastard.
2141,so you know justice is. . .
2142,"well, whatever. but still, blotted."
2143,blemished. and with scandal for a middle name.
2144,perhaps all your hopes die and you stop all your expectations.
2145,"or, perhaps you suddenly throw back you head"
2146,and laugh and laugh. . .
2147,whatever you chose to do
2148,the truth hits you
2149,when she whispers
2150,‘legitimacy is illegitimate.’
2151,deciphering a culture
2152,instruction #1 nailed to the wall: switch off your cellphones
2153,"keep smiling!  this is what i got to read on ink-splattered desks one lonely day in the central winners don’t library of the iit madras. i was there waiting for someone to come and join me frustrated and all the books surrounding me were such rigorous affairs in quantum mechanics one and ocean engineering and acoustics sided and though i had studied science at school, i had opted out of academics lovers for (shall we say) personal reasons."
2154,"and so there was literally nothing association in there that i could read and understand, so i set about staring at the desks (frustrated one sided lovers association) and suddenly the graffiti made sense (acronym fosla) and my reading picked up join fosla da! in leaps and fosla: exclusively for mother-fuckers like you bounds. watching it was so funny i liked the picture. . . because i imagined life begins at 40, ice cream expires at 2 nothing in these mass of bare! scientific and technical books with their !!superb!! mumbo-jumbo jargons could attract me lol! but these words i love rumour penned by different students was kind of distracting my kiss is bad and also a nice thing to my head is sad engage myself its your love in."

2156,instruction #2 nailed to the wall: don’t replace books to stack. leave them on the table.
2157,"the other words me too are silly me too da idiot and i try my best to take how dare you everything om namah shivaiah of this civilization morals r for morons by just to suck the marrow of life!

2158,and i was feeling blank and looking up and repeating wanna something hot?
2159,instruction #3 nailed to the wall: silence.
2160,the gods wake up
2161,another worst things with the gods is that
2162,they sleep most of the time—
2163,                          (they don’t even dream).
2164,if you happen to go near heaven:
2165,it is a very noisy boring place.
2166,and all that you get to hear there are—
2167,thirty three million synchronized godly snores.
2168,                          (the goddesses snore too).
2169,the gods sleep right through the prayers
2170,performed by the brahmins—
2171,                          (maybe they find it boring).
2172,"births, marriages, innumerable yagnas,"
2173,"brahmins take the center-stage, all the"
2174,"gods skip. also, “om” is now obsolete—"
2175,a kind of recurring mosquito buzz.
2176,"                          (besides, om is ©opyrighted)."
2177,"at times, the sleeping celestials do stir."
2178,gods always get excited over funerals—
2179,                          (they are kind of necrophilic).
2180,"the loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep,"
2181,ancient noises herald the escaping life.
2182,this deeper music shakes the skies.
2183,that’s when the gods wake up.
2184,                          (just to receive the dead.)
2185,"we watched it being seized away, all our lands."
2186,the government—a fulltime bewitching whore
2187,"had promised jobs. industrialization. power, electric."
2188,"everything went, nothing came."
2189,"now, landless, uprooted,"
2190,unsettled in a resettlement colony
2191,we feast our souls on lucent memories—of an earlier life.
2192,when memory charts
2193,i often recollect that
2194,long ago rainy sunday
2195,"in our crowded church,"
2196,fr. jose reading crisply
2197,“blessed are the meek
2198,for they shall inherit the earth.”
2199,elegy to my first keyboard
2200,you entered my life when i was twelve. i really didn’t
2201,have hormones then. i was lost in a different world. of
2202,"science, of space, and the small small atoms that we were"
2203,all made up of. i wanted to be a spy or a scientist. i
2204,thought you would help me become one.
2205,you made me fall in love. with you. and unknown to
2206,"my parents, with language."
2207,i started to write. but that is another story.
2208,i loved you too much. loved you through all those long
2209,nights when you made me cry. when you simply
2210,wouldn’t listen to me. and when i couldn’t find the
2211,words to tell my love to you.
2212,living with you was very memorable. too much fun.
2213,"and we were getting better by the day. at least, i was."
2214,until you decided to add some spice.
2215,i was too weak for them.
2216,"to stay ahead of me, you would type on your own. i"
2217,don\\\\\\\’t kno\\w what\ these sl\\\\\\\\ashes meant
2218,but they wo\\\\\\uld come everytime i sto\\\pped to
2219,"when you knew this didn’t excite me, you stopped."
2220,"in yopur effoprt at unity, yopu started putting the op’s"
2221,and p’s together. i never knew why.
2222,and-one-hot-summer-morning-the-space-bar-konked-out-i-had-to-separate-every-single-word-by-the-use-of-hyphens-or-dashes-and-i-could-not-even-run-the word-counts-and-oh-it-was-so-bad-but-still-i-put-up-with-you. familiarity-with-you-never-bred-contempt-it-gave-birth-to-love-to-comfort-to-knowing-all-your-little-quirks.disabling-that-vital-cord-which-tied-you-was-so-easy-and-even-so-legal-but-i-resisted-i-always-gave-you-chances-and-i-thought-that-your-teasing-would-be-over-soon-soon-anytime-soon-alas-it-was-not-to-be.you-had-grown-haughty-and-ill-tempered-and-god-i-still-loved-you.not-to-love-a-strong-woman-was-very-demeaning-on-me.
2223,one night you repaired yourself. i never asked you how.
2224,questions are prohibited in love affairs with me.
2225,"finally, you crashed."
2226,"you misbehaved, threw your tiny tantrums."
2227,you showed me your keyboard ego.
2228,or was it my zeal and drive.
2229,did i misuse-abuse-overuse you?
2230,i loved you. i still do.
2231,you were a great mistress.
2232,"only, you took an early retirement."
2233,when the god drank milk
2234,this was the second time
2235,he spanned the world
2236,so quickly. . . in telecast
2237,miracles that occurred from
2238,michigan to manila to madras
2239,"whether he was in plastic, ceramic,"
2240,fire-burnt clay or stiff black stone
2241,"the elephant-headed, the pot-bellied,"
2242,"the remover of obstacles, ganesha,"
2243,the god had his fill as he sucked
2244,the spoonfuls of creamy milk. . .
2245,i am not willing to listen to
2246,capillary action rationalism
2247,or any scientific explorations. . .
2248,instead i am hunting for some
2249,"silly girl’s bizarre secret, to know if"
2250,the son of shiva had let himself
2251,"to be breastfed, to be suckled. . ."
2252,"and if she, having tasted success"
2253,"at his having tasted her,"
2254,"moved on to younger,"
2255,with their mouths
2256,full of white teeth.
2257,in an arid land of arid human minds
2258,"caste, yet again authored a tragedy."
2259,"he, disease wrecked, downtrodden,"
2260,"long-ago skinner of animals, sets out."
2261,"ten days of typhoid, and a partial recovery."
2262,enough reason to thank some god.
2263,he drags himself clumsily to a nearby temple.
2264,"sadly, of an upper-caste god."
2265,"away from the temple, he bends in supplication."
2266,says his last prayer—unwelcome gratefulness.
2267,to a god who (anyway) didn’t help him recover.
2268,innocent acts of undulating faith spurned
2269,an irked rajput surged forth
2270,and smote the untouchable with a iron rod.
2271,"he, warrior caste lion couldn’t tolerate"
2272,encroachment. at the temple. by a dalit.
2273,deathly howls of a feeble-voiced
2274,"rent the air, fervently seeking holy intervention."
2275,"god, lifeless as ever—watched grimly with closed eyes."
2276,"in resigned submission, the sick man’s life was given away."
2277,"caste—crueler than disease, emotionless, dry, took its toll"
2278,"confirming traditional truths: dalits die, due to devotion."
2279,unanswered questions remain;
2280,agony is not always a forgotten memory.
2281,life teaches: there are different gods at different temples.
2282,one solitary thought haunts recollection day and night.
2283,where did this poor man’s sixty-five year old soul go?
2284,to heaven – to join noble martyrs who died for a cause?
2285,"or to hell—where the gods reside, making caste laws."
2286,i’ll weep to you about
2287,"my landlord, and with"
2288,my mature gestures—
2289,you will understand:
2290,"the torn sari, disheveled hair"
2291,stifled cries and meek submission.
2292,i was not an untouchable then.
2293,"i’ll curse the skies,"
2294,and shout: scream to you
2295,words that incite wrath and
2296,you will definitely know:
2297,"the priest, his lecherous eyes,"
2298,"glances that disrobed, defiled."
2299,i was not polluting at four feet.
2300,how can i say
2301,against my own man?
2302,so i take shelter in silence
2303,wear it like a mask.
2304,"when alone, i stumble"
2305,into a flood of incoherencies. . .
2306,we real hot
2307,(inspired by ‘we real cool’ by gwendolyn brooks)
2308,we real hot. we
2309,ne’er rot. we
2310,know knack. we

2320,mahatma. sorry no.
2321,stop it. enough taboo.
2322,that trash is long overdue.
2323,you need a thorough review.
2324,your tax-free salt stimulated our wounds
2325,"we gonna sue you, the congress shoe."
2326,"gone half-cuckoo, you called us names,"
2327,you dubbed us pariahs—“harijans”
2328,goody-goody guys of a bigot god
2329,ram ram hey ram—boo.
2330,don’t ever act like a holy saint.
2331,"we can see through you, impure you."
2332,"remember, how you dealt with your poor wife."
2333,"but, they wrote your books, they made your life."
2334,"they stuffed you up, the imposter true."
2335,and sew you up—filled you with virtue
2336,and gave you all that glossy deeds
2337,enough reason we still lick you.
2338,"you knew, you bloody well knew,"
2339,"caste won’t go, they wouldn’t let it go."
2340,"it haunts us now, the way you do"
2341,"with a spooky stick, a eerie laugh or two."
2342,"but they killed you, the naked you,"
2343,your blood with mud was gooey goo.
2344,"sadist fool, you killed your body"
2345,many times before this too.
2346,"bapu, bapu, you big fraud, we hate you."

2348,why upper caste gods
2349,"and their ‘good-girl’ much-married, father-fucked,"
2350,"virgin, vegetarian oh-so-pure goddesses"
2351,borne in their golden chariots
2352,don’t come to our streets.
2353,we know the reasons for their non-entry into slums.
2354,"actually, our poverty would soil their hears"
2355,and our labor corrupt their souls.

2372,                                haunting oppressors to shave their heads.
2373,                                cutting all their holy threads.

2404,(for tomorrow’s papers). . .
2405,our huts are burning—
2406,regular huts in proper rows.
2407,dry thatches (conspirators-in-crime)
2408,feed the flames as we rush out
2409,open mouthed hysterical curses
2410,and as if in an answer—
2411,when the blazing work is done
2412,fire engines arrive . . .
2413,these feverish cries continue
2414,in the same shrilly pitch
2415,"echo, echo, echo and"
2416,finally reach. . .
2417,reverberate and sound as loud
2418,as snail shells crackling under nailed boots
2419,and perhaps as distinct and defenseless.
2420,this double catastrophe projected in sights
2421,and shrieks evokes. . .
2422,those above are (mostly):
2423,you are possessed.
2424,"witch doctors believe in phantoms,"
2425,"that cause your illness. but, driving out devils"
2426,can be challenging. spirits are given away—
2427,"we are made to sit opposite you,"
2428,force-fed a ‘meal’—bland food mixed
2429,"with your hair, nails, spit and pus."
2430,"illegally (despite the government ban),"
2431,we take your hoard of evil spirits
2432,barter-system: for having ate your food.
2433,and because ghosts and ghouls
2434,"obey your rules, they leave you to come to us."
2435,is this ‘transference’? an unofficial appeasement.
2436,"we become inhabited by the dead,"
2437,who ruins our doomed lives. demons in our
2438,"bodies are brutal tenants and frequently,"
2439,they suck with their vampire tongues
2440,to drink our anemic blood —
2441,"leave their puncture marks, which"
2442,can be faintly seen on our black skins;
2443,"skins that bear greater scars,"
2444,"reminders of larger, human cruelty. . ."
2445,"anyway, there isn’t a lot of life in our bodies."
2446,"we are souls. wandering souls. still, once"
2447,"ghost-tasted, we rot away. we rot away."
2448,"remember, rotting is a long procedure. . ."
2449,"day by day, we grow coffin cold and slowly"
2450,"life creeps out, a lazy earthworm."
2451,"at last, we die."
2452,this note comes as a consolation:
2453,                 you can do a lot of things
2454,                 with your left hand.

2458,"                 you don’t need your right thumb,"

2475,another paradise lost
2476,"one sleepy summer afternoon, while helping"
2477,"myself to a glass of chilled water, i saw a"
2478,snake lying curled under the fridge. it could
2479,have been a very poisonous cobra. very
2480,"quickly, i chose my mode of attack: acid."
2481,"staggering, i reached for the glass bottle"
2482,so that i could pour the yellow-green cheap
2483,"acid on its slimy body, burning it to death."
2484,"“stop it”, the snake hissed in pure tamil"
2485,connecting with me in the language of
2486,my prayer and poetry. “i am an exile.”
2487,and i configured mental images of political
2488,refugees. it wriggled out and i saw that
2489,"it was balding, almost rushdie-like, perhaps"
2490,with a death sentence too. controversy was a
2491,"crowd pulling catch-phrase, to which i dutifully"
2492,"succumbed. acid bottle in hand, i heard the"
2493,snake preach to me about living in detachment.
2494,“the perfection of life is when you do not
2495,know the difference between yielding and
2496,resisting.” the scrawny being writhed further
2497,and told me of rebirth and reincarnation. being
2498,a writer i really wanted to take notes. instead
2499,"i began arguing. “shut up”, the snake said to me,"
2500,“karma and the whole stuff that follows it is just
2501,"bunkum. you, a crazed agnostic, disagree because"
2502,of borrowed ideas.” sharp movements of the red
2503,"tongue terrified me. almost sensing my fear, it"
2504,"said, “you could never challenge what you do"
2505,"not comprehend.” the snake spoke in circles, in"
2506,patterns that could only resemble a snake
2507,swallowing its tail. whatever. and then it
2508,"occurred to me: speech was the oldest trap,"
2509,"the charming deceiver, persuasion’s weapon"
2510,"and satan’s first area of expertise. “stop it”,"
2511,this time i said the words. “tell me just your
2512,story. save the cant and rant for critical times.”
2513,my acidic tone gained me a menacing status
2514,"and i continued, “you are a mean serpent."
2515,instigator. trouble-maker. sly liar. undulating
2516,temptation-provider. unworthy reminder
2517,of the seduction of strength over matter.” it
2518,"protested in a booming resonant voice, “no, i"
2519,"am not any of this. i am just an exile, from"
2520,"paradise. because of your catholic upbringing,"
2521,you don’t even know about the paradise lost
2522,in hinduism.” who bothered for history or
2523,"heritage, except shriveling snakes and failed"
2524,"writers? at least, we both had something in"
2525,"common. “look here comrade, my credentials"
2526,"are different. in heaven, i was an activist. an"
2527,"avid dissenter. before the accession to heaven,"
2528,"long long ago, i was a mighty monarch on earth,"
2529,feared and respected. i was nahusa the great.
2530,"my subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous."
2531,"and i ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day"
2532,when i decided that i could take leave of life. in
2533,"heaven too, i was venerated. but one question had"
2534,"plagued me all the years of my long life, and it still"
2535,tormented me in heaven. i wanted to know why
2536,"caste was there, why people suffered because of"
2537,"their karmas. i questioned the gods, and the learned"
2538,sages there. i asked them what would happen if an
2539,high-born did manual work just like the low-born.
2540,"i worried about the division of labor, this disparity"
2541,in dreams and destinies. you could say i was a rebel
2542,pleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. i had a riotous
2543,"history of revolution. the gods plotted against me,"
2544,decided that i was trouble. i was cursed to turn into
2545,a vile snake. i was banished from paradise. for sixty
2546,"million years, i shall roam the earth, and then i may"
2547,return.” this was a different case of the paradise lost.
2548,"in this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second"
2549,fickle-minded woman. tradition triumphed over reason
2550,"and the good were cast away. i let the serpent go,"
2551,"happy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or"
2552,"perhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. i began"
2553,to respect snakes — the challengers of hierarchy.
2554,while i gave him the freedom of safe passage
2555,i vowed never to kill serpents. much later
2556,i realized brutally that this was just another
2557,occupational hazard for choosing a life
2558,where i was to be showing solidarity
2559,with activists and dissenters.
2560,ours is a silence
2561,that waits. endlessly waits.
2562,"and then, unable to bear it"
2563,"any further, it breaks into wails."
2564,but not all suppressed reactions
2565,end in our bemoaning the tragedy.
2566,the outward signals
2567,of inward struggles takes colossal forms
2568,and the revolution happens because our dreams explode.
2569,most of the time:
2570,aggression is the best kind of trouble-shooting.
2571,advaita: the ultimate question
2572,non                                      dualism

2576,and                                      same.
2577,so                                         i

2580,will                                       you
2581,ever                                      agree?
2582,no                                        matter
2583,what                                     you
2584,preach                                  answer
2585,me.                                       through
2586,your                                     saints.
2587,one                                      more
2588,final                                     question
2589,can                                      my
2590,untouchable                        atman
2591,and                                      your
2592,brahmin                               atman
2593,ever                                     be
2594,                     one
2595,                      ?
2596,have you ever tried meditation?
2597,"struggling hard to concentrate,"
2598,and keeping your mind as blank
2599,as a whitewashed wall by closing
2600,"your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out"
2601,every possible thought. every thing.
2602,"and, the only failure, that ever came,"
2603,the only gross betrayal—
2604,was from your own skin.
2605,                    you will have known this.
2606,"do you still remember,"
2607,"how, the first distractions arose?"
2608,and you blamed skin as a sinner;
2609,"how, when your kundalini was rising,"
2610,"shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor"
2611,"skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes,"
2612,"how, even in a far-off different realm—"
2613,your skin anchored you to this earth.
2614,"amidst all that pervading emptiness,"
2615,touch retained its sensuality.
2616,                    you will have known this.
2617,"or if you thought more variedly, about"
2618,"taste, you would discount it—as the touch"
2619,"of the tongue. or, you may recollect"
2620,"how a gentle touch, a caress changed"
2621,"your life multifold, and you were never"
2622,the person you should have been.
2623,"feeling with your skin, was"
2624,"perhaps the first of the senses, its"
2625,reality always remained with you—
2626,you never got rid of it.
2627,                    you will have known this.
2628,you will have known almost
2629,every knowledgeable thing about
2630,the charms and the temptations
2631,that touch could hold.
2632,"but, you will never have known"
2633,that touch – the taboo
2634,"to your transcendence,"
2635,when crystallized in caste
2636,was a paraphernalia of
2637,love and war
2638,two thousand years ago
2639,our word for love
2640,was the same.
2641,women and men
2642,wrote their songs of love
2643,the intimacies of inside
2644,and they spoke of how
2645,love was tireless
2646,love was a fantasy feast
2647,love was no disease
2648,love was no evil goddess
2649,"love was a harshness, in the parting"
2650,             ‘the thing that made a girl’s bangles
2651,             slip loose when her lord went away
2652,             grow tight when her lord returned’
2653,love was (they sang)
2654,             ‘bigger than the earth
2655,             higher than the sky
2656,             unfathomable than the waters.’
2657,no names were named.
2658,you did not know
2659,             who he was
2660,             or who she was
2661,             or when it was
2662,             or where it was
2663,and there were
2664,"the poems of war,"
2665,the war poetry
2666,poems on the outside
2667,because the bards
2668,wore lotuses of gold)
2669,where the names were named
2670,where the kings were praised
2671,where a bard addressed another
2672,where the guide sang to the patron
2673,where the poet sang to the courtesan
2674,where mothers spoke of tigers in their wombs
2675,where the kingdom was
2676,             ‘an unfailing harvest of
2677,             victorious wars’
2678,where the old women
2679,             ‘threatened to slash their breasts
2680,             if their sons died in battle with backs
2681,             turned in fright’
2682,where the end spoke of
2683,             ‘the blood glowing
2684,             in the red center of the battlefield
2685,             like the sky before nightfall’
2686,and because it has an end
2687,war was a history.
2688,love never has an end.
2689,love was. and will be.
2690,if everything comes crashing down
2691,and both of us become strangers onto each other
2692,do not worry about me.
2693,we will look beyond eyes and run into each other
2694,"as usual, for the rest of life."
2695,i do not know what you would
2696,treasure of me in your mind.
2697,but in billboards planted
2698,"across my fervent heart,"
2699,i will celebrate you as the man
2700,who made me woman.
2701,and there are the small things that i would always remember:
2702,your affinity to catch colds; my rising fevers on seeing you
2703,"your headaches, your backaches; my avowed helplessness"
2704,your falling asleep while waiting for my reply
2705,your asking me to remain with you for all of time. . .
2706,all your delicious lies. . .
2707,"over the phone,"
2708,"               the sound of your drinking water,"
2709,               the soundlessness of your yawn. . .
2710,               the camouflage of who you were talking to
2711,               the new meanings you gave to worn-out words
2712,"yes, all of this."
2713,"and that once,"
2714,you called me a goddess.
2715,i speak alone because
2716,i do not know his answers.
2717,"                    and yet, you want to be heard."
2718,i want to tell him that i have
2719,closed and sealed my skin.
2720,"                    baby, i told you, love can hurt."
2721,i have exiled my heart.
2722,"                    this is a lonely, lonely world,"
2723,                    even with a lover.
2724,since i know the difference
2725,between believing and being in love
2726,                    oh! you know nothing.
2727,i have stopped
2728,my frantic search
2729,for the buddhas
2730,"                    only they came to you,"
2731,"                    in ones, twos, tens."
2732,when i thought of
2733,"yasodhara, his wife"
2734,left behind alone and
2735,large with child . . .
2736,"                    what about the good things, eh?"
2737,                    recollect them. remember that
2738,                    memory is a mere vending machine . . 
2739,he replaces poetry
2740,two months into love and today i turn into a whore
2741,"hunting for words, tearing them out from soiled sheets"
2742,of mind or pinching them from the world like removing
2743,jade-green flecks from tiger’s eyes. . . and poetry refuses
2744,entry into my mirrored life that is bequeathed to him.
2745,i try the mad-woman’s antics: i have pulled my hair and
2746,bruised my thin wrists and bit the insides of my cheeks till
2747,they have bled a warm red sourness and i have starved
2748,in arrogance to call the words home to me and thrown up
2749,"to clear me of him but he, strong dark man, refuses to budge,"
2750,give way or take leave. my dark nights of savage tears have
2751,gone in search of needy shores deserting me (with the devil
2752,of a lover who sleeps half-a-dozen streams apart) and so
2753,have the words that once made me the sad lone woman
2754,"i was, and pretended to be. i am happy now he says and"
2755,"i nod, like a tanjore doll in breeze, and reply in cloying tones"
2756,this is happiness. i know i do not indulge in lies or delusion but
2757,this is happiness and happiness is a hollow world for fools to
2758,"inhabit, where all the dreams eventually die by coming to life."
2759,love has smothered me to a gay inertia and i long for a little
2760,hurt and pain that will let me scream and i wait for offending
2761,words to row me into worlds where i shall cry wildly for whole
2762,"nights like the lament of lonely, old and greying seas. . . then"
2763,sadness shall come back with its dancing fairy lights and nail me
2764,"to wailing crosses. . . poetry, in the end, shall replace all of him."
2765,non-conversations with a lover
2766,don’t talk to me
2767,of sudden love. . .
2768,in our land
2769,even the monsoons come—
2770,"leisurely, strolling like"
2771,decorated temple elephants
2772,"(the pomp, the paraphernalia)—"
2773,"after months of monotonous prayer,"
2774,preparations and palpitating waits.
2775,(those still shoulders)
2776,but his eyes dance
2777,his eyes dance
2778,"(so wild, so wild)"
2779,so i think of raging
2780,like uncontrollable tuskers
2781,trampling in mast
2782,"(the madness, the lust)—"
2783,across the forests of our land. . .
2784,and i got your words
2785,i will have them painted
2786,try to choose
2787,or take them all.
2788,glitter on innocent
2789,raspberry lips that plead
2790,"for touch, for closer"
2791,composition in coffee
2792,cream blending with bitter
2793,chocolate worn on business
2794,"ravenous red, for fiery"
2795,"animals in us, tamed,"
2796,by love in dying
2797,"colourless words, invisible"
2798,reserved for needy
2799,"love, remember the rain"
2800,and our fading words
2801,on lonely nights
2802,straying to a steady
2803,chatter or studied
2804,which still linger on lips.
2805,remember that some words
2806,which once beheld promise
2807,now hold our bodies
2808,anaconda. candy. cash. catamaran.
2809,cheroot. coolie. corundum. curry.
2810,ginger. mango. mulligatawny.
2811,patchouli. poppadom. rice.
2812,tatty. teak. vetiver.
2813,i dream of an english
2814,full of the words of my language.
2815,an english in small letters
2816,an english that shall tire a white man’s tongue
2817,an english where small children practice with smooth round
2818, pebbles in their mouth to the spell the right zha
2819,an english where a pregnant woman is simply stomach-child-lady
2820,an english where the magic of black eyes and brown bodies 
2821,   replaces the glamour of eyes in dishwater blue shades 
2822,   and the airbrush romance of pink white cherry blossom skins
2823,an english where love means only the strange frenzy
2824,"   between a man and his beloved, not between him and his car"
2825,an english without the privacy of its many rooms
2826,an english with suffixes for respect

2836,you don’t know if you are yielding or resisting
2837,it is the last day of the year
2838,and you think about writing
2839,a farewell poem for the year
2840,"that was, for the year you"
2841,began writing poetry
2842,you think of the tragedies
2843,"you know, you even plan"
2844,to write about naming your only
2845,"daughter (whenever she is born,"
2846,anyway) after a suicide-bomber
2847,you try to think of fear and hate
2848,and some devious defence for all
2849,those sins you had painstakingly
2850,planned to do just so that your
2851,poetry has more life and colour
2852,and verve and in the end it might
2853,appear that you have experience
2854,you strive like mad to avoid writing
2855,"poems about your unseen lover,"
2856,you concede deep within that you
2857,do not know his name or age or what
2858,"he murders for a living, yet he weaves"
2859,his way into every poem of yours
2860,you want to write that single poem
2861,"which is free of him, which does not"
2862,carry the stains of his masculine scent
2863,and which doesn’t make you think of
2864,his hairless chest and the deftness of his
2865,fingers on you and god yes god his eyes
2866,"you want to write a poem just for yourself,"
2867,a poem where you do not cringe
2868,or stand shame-faced at his
2869,worship of himself and how
2870,silently and steadfastly he
2871,has made you worship him
2872,you have always known that
2873,your knowledge of him was
2874,very limited—that expecting
2875,the stranger to caress you when
2876,you cry is an insane idea—
2877,after all when your lover comes
2878,he has no memory about the
2879,days and months and years he has
2880,spent inside your heart and he does
2881,not wish to hear for how long you
2882,have harboured him right between
2883,you notice the clock tick away
2884,and again you give up writing
2885,that poem for it always eludes you
2886,you succumb to all your cravings
2887,and write all you can about him
2888,forgetting the shame and the
2889,embarrassment it would cause
2890,somehow it seems better than
2891,not writing anything at all.

2898,wishes boiled to a blend.
2899,three cinnamon pods
2900,the dried darjeeling leaves
2901,milk and pearl-white cream
2902,simmering to a syrup to be filtered.
2903,as you sweat in its vapours
2904,and imagine how the tea tastes
2905,against his lips his teeth his tongue
2906,and the pale pink insides of his throat
2907,as you stir in the sugar
2908,and test a spoonful to see
2909,if it stings and soothes and
2910,stimulates the way you intended
2911,as you pour it into his cup
2912,with eyes mirroring supernovas and
2913,study the desirable brown of the tea
2914,an entire shade
2915,that fits exactly
2916,between the desert sand of your skin
2917,and the date palm of his.
2918,almost the color
2919,of your possible child.
2920,when you called me
2921,to light up your life
2922,i could never refuse.
2923,"but, there are things i ask of you."
2924,"love, i can’t be a candle"
2925,for i know it is an ancient lie.
2926,"the candle is for the solemn,"
2927,and for those who yearn a slow
2928,and settled tenderness. not for us.
2929,it is for those who can bear to leave
2930,"a mass of their waste, the dregs of their glory."
2931,"o, it is for the selfish who seek to burn through a medium."
2932,"love, i will promise you a substitute."
2933,i could be that piece of holy camphor
2934,so safely locked away from prying hands.
2935,"and dearest, when i burn for you, that single time"
2936,"nothing shall remain of me, or of you, except that flash"
2937,"of memory. our blending shall be so sublime, so intense, so total."
2938,"come, consume me,"
2939,"devastate me love, if you ever will,"
2940,but with a force that i will forever remember.
2941,my bed smells of textbooks
2942,"and it is more than a month or so,"
2943,since i dreamt of sunlight and the sky’s
2944,embrace. even a woman’s lush vanities —
2945,scarlet silk and shining gold — have been lost
2946,"on me. i am snared in a world of aqua, fuchsia,"
2947,and lime set dangerously against black and white.
2948,"words tightly wrapped,"
2949,and imprisoned in a cluster of
2950,"highlighter colours, share my slavery."
2951,"rattling loud, the colorized intrusions"
2952,"have pickled the past, leaving me to savour"
2953,"saturation. oh hell, even my treasured dreams"
2954,"have been bleached away in shades of three, or five."
2955,"save me, from this"
2956,of fluorescence; where lines
2957,"rehash the pages brutally, moving"
2958,with sounds of spectacled scrutiny.
2959,"for, all that i can bear to comprehend"
2960,is the loss of dare: my sheltered cowardice.
2961,"and, the sole comfort i crave, through stifled"
2962,tears is stolen love beneath stained glass windows.
2963,"dearest, lavish your love"
2964,"in slender earthtone shades,"
2965,in the colours of skin singing —
2966,"to shield our renewed dreams,"
2967,"and to believe, once more, in absolutes."

2971,lead him into the land
2972,of silences—ignore his words of praise
2973,where all the perfidy hides. . .

2989,that tickled your shins. and of a cruel world that sapped
2990,"you, so your hair cannot reach down to cover your shame. . ."

3291,"just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me"
3292,you never say a word when father writes.
3293,"when my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't"
3294,seem to mind at all.
3295,"but if i take only one sheet to take a boat with, you say,"
3296,"""child, how troublesome you are!"""
3297,what do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of
3298,paper with black marks all over both sides?
3299,baby's way 
3300,"if baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment."
3301,it is not for nothing that he does not leave us.
3302,"he loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever"
3303,bear to lose sight of her.
3304,"baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can"
3305,understand their meaning.
3306,it is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.
3307,the one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from
3308,mother's lips. that is why he looks so innocent.
3309,"baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar"
3310,on to this earth.
3311,it is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.
3312,this dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
3313,"helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love."
3314,baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
3315,it was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.
3316,he knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little
3317,"corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught"
3318,and pressed in her dear arms.
3319,baby never knew how to cry. he dwelt in the land of perfect
3320,it is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.
3321,though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's
3322,"yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles"
3323,weave the double bond of pity and love.
3324,beggarly heart 
3325,"when the heart is hard and parched up, "
3326,come upon me with a shower of mercy. 
3327,"when grace is lost from life, "
3328,come with a burst of song. 
3329,when tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from 
3330,"beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest. "
3331,"when my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, "
3332,"break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king. "
3333,"when desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, o thou holy one, "
3334,"thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder"
3335,"bless this little heart, this white soul that has won the kiss of"
3336,heaven for our earth.
3337,"he loves the light of the sun, he loves the sight of his"
3338,"he has not learned to despise the dust, and to hanker after"
3339,clasp him to your heart and bless him.
3340,he has come into this land of an hundred cross-roads.
3341,"i know not how he chose you from the crowd, came to your door,"
3342,and grasped you hand to ask his way.
3343,"he will follow you, laughing the talking, and not a doubt in"
3344,"keep his trust, lead him straight and bless him."
3345,"lay your hand on his head, and pray that though the waves"
3346,"underneath grow threatening, yet the breath from above may come and"
3347,fill his sails and waft him to the heaven of peace.
3348,"forget him not in your hurry, let him come to your heart and"
3349,brink of eternity 
3350,in desperate hope i go and search for her 
3351,in all the corners of my room; 
3352,i find her not. 
3353,my house is small 
3354,and what once has gone from it can never be regained. 
3355,"but infinite is thy mansion, my lord, "
3356,and seeking her i have to come to thy door. 
3357,i stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky 
3358,and i lift my eager eyes to thy face. 
3359,i have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish 
3360,"---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears. "
3361,"oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, "
3362,plunge it into the deepest fullness. 
3363,let me for once feel that lost sweet touch 
3364,in the allness of the universe.
3365,chain of pearls 
3366,"mother, i shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck "
3367,with my tears of sorrow. 
3368,"the stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, "
3369,but mine will hang upon thy breast. 
3370,wealth and fame come from thee 
3371,and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. 
3372,"but this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, "
3373,and when i bring it to thee as my offering 
3374,thou rewardest me with thy grace.
3375,closed path 
3376,i thought that my voyage had come to its end 
3377,"at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed, "
3378,that provisions were exhausted 
3379,and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity. 
3380,but i find that thy will knows no end in me. 
3381,"and when old words die out on the tongue, "
3382,new melodies break forth from the heart; 
3383,"and where the old tracks are lost, "
3384,new country is revealed with its wonders.
3385,clouds and waves
3386,"mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-"
3387,"""we play from the time we wake till the day ends."
3388,"we play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon."""
3389,"i ask, ""but how am i to get up to you ?"""
3390,"they answer, ""come to the edge of the earth, lift up your"
3391,"hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."""
3392,"""my mother is waiting for me at home, ""i say, ""how can i leave"
3393,"her and come?"""
3394,then they smile and float away.
3395,"but i know a nicer game than that, mother."
3396,i shall be the cloud and you the moon.
3397,"i shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will"
3398,be the blue sky.
3399,the folk who live in the waves call out to me-
3400,"""we sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know"
3401,"not where we pass."""
3402,"i ask, ""but how am i to join you?"""
3403,"they tell me, ""come to the edge of the shore and stand with"
3404,"your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."""
3405,"i say, ""my mother always wants me at home in the everything-"
3406,"how can i leave her and go?"""
3407,"they smile, dance and pass by."
3408,but i know a better game than that.
3409,i will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.
3410,"i shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with"
3411,and no one in the world will know where we both are.
3412,colored toys 
3413,"when i bring to you colored toys, my child, "
3414,"i understand why there is such a play of colors on clouds, on water, "
3415,and why flowers are painted in tints 
3416,"---when i give colored toys to you, my child. "
3417,when i sing to make you dance 
3418,"i truly now why there is music in leaves, "
3419,and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth 
3420,---when i sing to make you dance. 
3421,when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands 
3422,i know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers 
3423,and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice 
3424,---when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands. 
3425,"when i kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, "
3426,"i surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, "
3427,and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body 
3428,---when i kiss you to make you smile.
3429,"whey are those tears in your eyes, my child?"
3430,how horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!
3431,you have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
3432,is that why they call you dirty?
3433,"o, fie! would they dare to call the full moon dirty because"
3434,it has smudged its face with ink?
3435,"for every little trifle they blame you, my child. they are"
3436,ready to find fault for nothing.
3437,you tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
3438,"o, fie! what would they call an autumn morning that smiles"
3439,through its ragged clouds?
3440,"take no heed of what they say to you, my child."
3441,they make a long list of your misdeeds.
3442,everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
3443,call you greedy?
3444,"o, fie! what then would they call us who love you?"
3445,distant time 
3446,i know not from what distant time 
3447,thou art ever coming nearer to meet me. 
3448,thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye. 
3449,in many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard 
3450,and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret. 
3451,"i know not only why today my life is all astir, "
3452,and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart. 
3453,"it is as if the time were come to wind up my work, "
3454,and i feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence.
3455,he whom i enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. 
3456,i am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into 
3457,the sky day by day i lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow. 
3458,"i take pride in this great wall, and i plaster it with dust and sand "
3459,lest a least hole should be left in this name; 
3460,and for all the care i take i lose sight of my true being
3461,endless time by rabindranath tagore
3462,"time is endless in thy hands, my lord. "
3463,there is none to count thy minutes. 
3464,days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. 
3465,thou knowest how to wait. 
3466,thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower. 
3467,"we have no time to lose, "
3468,and having no time we must scramble for a chance. 
3469,we are too poor to be late. 
3470,and thus it is that time goes by 
3471,"while i give it to every querulous man who claims it, "
3472,and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last. 
3473,at the end of the day i hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; 
3474,but i find that yet there is time.
3475,face to face 
3476,"day after day, o lord of my life, "
3477,shall i stand before thee face to face. 
3478,"with folded hands, o lord of all worlds, "
3479,shall i stand before thee face to face. 
3480,"under thy great sky in solitude and silence, "
3481,with humble heart shall i stand before thee face to face. 
3482,"in this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil "
3483,"and with struggle, among hurrying crowds "
3484,shall i stand before thee face to face. 
3485,"and when my work shall be done in this world, "
3486,"o king of kings, alone and speechless "
3487,shall i stand before thee face to face.
3488,"if people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish "
3489,into the air.
3490,the walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.
3491,"the queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she"
3492,wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.
3493,"but let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's"
3494,it is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi
3495,the princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven
3496,there is none in the world who can find her but myself.
3497,she has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her
3498,hair sweeps down upon the floor.
3499,she will wake when i touch her with my magic wand and jewels
3500,will fall from her lips when she smiles.
3501,"but let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the"
3502,corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.
3503,"when it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step"
3504,up to that terrace on the roof.
3505,i sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet
3506,"only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the"
3507,barber in the story lives.
3508,"but let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in"
3509,the story lives.
3510,it is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsi
3511,"i have got my leave. bid me farewell, my brothers! "
3512,i bow to you all and take my departure. 
3513,here i give back the keys of my door 
3514,---and i give up all claims to my house. 
3515,i only ask for last kind words from you. 
3516,"we were neighbors for long, "
3517,but i received more than i could give. 
3518,now the day has dawned 
3519,and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. 
3520,a summons has come and i am ready for my journey.
3521,flower by rabindranath tagore
3522,"pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! i fear lest it "
3523,droop and drop into the dust. 
3524,"i may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of "
3525,pain from thy hand and pluck it. i fear lest the day end before i am 
3526,"aware, and the time of offering go by. "
3527,"though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower "
3528,in thy service and pluck it while there is time.
3529,"o fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! "
3530,"o beggar, to come beg at thy own door! "
3531,"leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, "
3532,and never look behind in regret. 
3533,thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.
3534,it is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. 
3535,accept only what is offered by sacred love.
3536,free love 
3537,by all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. 
3538,"but it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, "
3539,and thou keepest me free. 
3540,lest i forget them they never venture to leave me alone. 
3541,but day passes by after day and thou art not seen. 
3542,"if i call not thee in my prayers, if i keep not thee in my heart, "
3543,thy love for me still waits for my love.
3544,art thou abroad on this stormy night 
3545,"on thy journey of love, my friend? "
3546,the sky groans like one in despair. 
3547,i have no sleep tonight. 
3548,ever and again i open my door and look out on 
3549,"the darkness, my friend! "
3550,i can see nothing before me. 
3551,i wonder where lies thy path! 
3552,"by what dim shore of the ink-black river, "
3553,"by what far edge of the frowning forest, "
3554,through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
3555,"thy course to come to me, my friend?"
3556,give me strength
3557,"this is my prayer to thee, my lord---strike, "
3558,strike at the root of penury in my heart. 
3559,give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows. 
3560,give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service. 
3561,give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might. 
3562,give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. 
3563,and give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.
3564,innermost one 
3565,"he it is, the innermost one, "
3566,who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches. 
3567,he it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes 
3568,and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart 
3569,in varied cadence of pleasure and pain. 
3570,he it is who weaves the web of this maya 
3571,"in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green, "
3572,"and lets peep out through the folds his feet, "
3573,at whose touch i forget myself. 
3574,"days come and ages pass, "
3575,"and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name, "
3576,"in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow."
3577,journey home 
3578,the time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long. 
3579,"i came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my "
3580,voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet. 
3581,"it is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, "
3582,and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune. 
3583,"the traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, "
3584,and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end. 
3585,my eyes strayed far and wide before i shut them and said `here art thou!' 
3586,"the question and the cry `oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand "
3587,streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `i am!'
3588,last curtain 
3589,i know that the day will come 
3590,"when my sight of this earth shall be lost, "
3591,"and life will take its leave in silence, "
3592,drawing the last curtain over my eyes. 
3593,"yet stars will watch at night, "
3594,"and morning rise as before, "
3595,and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains. 
3596,"when i think of this end of my moments, "
3597,the barrier of the moments breaks 
3598,and i see by the light of death 
3599,thy world with its careless treasures. 
3600,"rare is its lowliest seat, "
3601,rare is its meanest of lives. 
3602,things that i longed for in vain 
3603,and things that i got 
3604,---let them pass. 
3605,let me but truly possess 
3606,the things that i ever spurned 
3607,leave this 
3608,leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! 
3609,whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? 
3610,open thine eyes and see thy god is not before thee! 
3611,he is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground 
3612,and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. 
3613,"he is with them in sun and in shower, "
3614,and his garment is covered with dust. 
3615,put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! 
3616,where is this deliverance to be found? 
3617,our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; 
3618,he is bound with us all for ever. 
3619,come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! 
3620,what harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? 
3621,meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.
3622,let me not forget
3623,if it is not my portion to meet thee in this life 
3624,then let me ever feel that i have missed thy sight 
3625,"---let me not forget for a moment, "
3626,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
3627,and in my wakeful hours. 
3628,as my days pass in the crowded market of this world 
3629,"and my hands grow full with the daily profits, "
3630,let me ever feel that i have gained nothing 
3631,"---let me not forget for a moment, "
3632,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
3633,and in my wakeful hours. 
3634,"when i sit by the roadside, tired and panting, "
3635,"when i spread my bed low in the dust, "
3636,let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me 
3637,"---let me not forget a moment, "
3638,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
3639,and in my wakeful hours. 
3640,when my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound 
3641,"and the laughter there is loud, "
3642,let me ever feel that i have not invited thee to my house 
3643,"---let me not forget for a moment, "
3644,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
3645,and in my wakeful hours
3646,"light, my light, the world-filling light, "
3647,"the eye-kissing light, "
3648,heart-sweetening light! 
3649,"ah, the light dances, my darling, at the center of my life; "
3650,"the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; "
3651,"the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth. "
3652,the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. 
3653,lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light. 
3654,"the light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, "
3655,and it scatters gems in profusion. 
3656,"mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, "
3657,and gladness without measure. 
3658,the heaven's river has drowned its banks 
3659,and the flood of joy is abroad.
3660,little flute 
3661,"thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. this frail "
3662,"vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. "
3663,"this little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, "
3664,and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new. 
3665,at the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in 
3666,joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable. 
3667,thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. 
3668,"ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill."
3669,little of me 
3670,let only that little be left of me 
3671,whereby i may name thee my all. 
3672,let only that little be left of my will 
3673,"whereby i may feel thee on every side, "
3674,"and come to thee in everything, "
3675,and offer to thee my love every moment. 
3676,let only that little be left of me 
3677,whereby i may never hide thee. 
3678,let only that little of my fetters be left 
3679,"whereby i am bound with thy will, "
3680,and thy purpose is carried out in my life---and that is the fetter of thy love.
3681,lost star 
3682,when the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first 
3683,"splendor, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang "
3684,"`oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!' "
3685,but one cried of a sudden 
3686,---`it seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light 
3687,and one of the stars has been lost.' 
3688,"the golden string of their harp snapped, "
3689,"their song stopped, and they cried in dismay "
3690,"---`yes, that lost star was the best, "
3691,she was the glory of all heavens!' 
3692,"from that day the search is unceasing for her, "
3693,and the cry goes on from one to the other 
3694,that in her the world has lost its one joy! 
3695,only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile 
3696,and whisper among themselves 
3697,---`vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'
3698,lost time 
3699,on many an idle day have i grieved over lost time. 
3700,"but it is never lost, my lord. "
3701,thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands. 
3702,"hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, "
3703,"buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness. "
3704,i was tired and sleeping on my idle bed 
3705,and imagined all work had ceased. 
3706,in the morning i woke up 
3707,and found my garden full with wonders of flowers.
3708,"on the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, "
3709,and i knew it not. my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. 
3710,"only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and i started up from my "
3711,dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. 
3712,that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to 
3713,me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion. 
3714,"i knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this "
3715,perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.
3716,lover's gifts ii: come to my garden walk 
3717,"come to my garden walk, my love. pass by the fervid flowers that"
3718,"press themselves on your sight. pass them by, stopping at some"
3719,"chance joy, which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines, yet"
3720,"for lover's gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits"
3721,"across the shade, spreading a shiver of joy along the dust."
3722,overtake it or miss it for ever. but a gift that can be
3723,"grasped is merely a frail flower, or a lamp with flame that will"
3724,lover's gifts iv: she is near to my heart 
3725,she is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is
3726,sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs. my love for her is my life
3727,"flowing in its fullness, like a river in autumn flood, running with"
3728,"serene abandonment. my songs are one with my love, like the murmur"
3729,"of a stream, that sings with all its waves and current."
3730,lover's gifts lii: tired of waiting 
3731,"tired of waiting, you burst your bonds, impatient flowers, before"
3732,the winter had gone. glimpses of the unseen comer reached your
3733,"wayside watch, and you rushed out running and panting, impulsive"
3734,"jasmines, troops of riotous roses."
3735,"you were the first to march to the breach of death, your"
3736,clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air. you laughed and
3737,"pressed and pushed each other, bared your breast and dropped in"
3738,"the summer will come in its time, sailing in the flood-tide"
3739,of the south wind. but you never counted slow moments to be sure
3740,"of him. you recklessly spent your all in the road, in the terrible"
3741,joy of faith.
3742,"you heard his footsteps from afar, and flung your mantle of"
3743,death for him to tread upon. your bonds break even before the
3744,"rescuer is seen, you make him your own ere he can come and claim"
3745,lover's gifts liv: in the beginning of time 
3746,"in the beginning of time, there rose from the churning of god's"
3747,"dream two women. one is the dancer at the court of paradise, the"
3748,"desired of men, she who laughs and plucks the minds of the wise"
3749,from their cold meditations and of fools from their emptiness; and
3750,scatters them like seeds with careless hands in the extravagant
3751,"winds of march, in the flowering frenzy of may."
3752,"the other is the crowned queen of heaven, the mother, throned"
3753,on the fullness of golden autumn; she who in the harvest-time
3754,"brings straying hearts to the smile sweet as tears, the beauty deep"
3755,"as the sea of silence, -brings them to the temple of the unknown,"
3756,at the holy confluence of life and death.
3757,lover's gifts lviii: things throng and laugh 
3758,things throng and laugh loud in the sky; the sands and dust dance
3759,and whirl like children. man's mind is aroused by their shouts; his
3760,thoughts long to be the playmates of things.
3761,"our dreams, drifting in the stream of the vague, stretch their"
3762,"arms to clutch the earth, -their efforts stiffen into bricks and"
3763,"stones, and thus the city of man is built."
3764,"voices come swarming from the past,-seeking answers from the"
3765,living moments. beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous
3766,"shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to"
3767,"take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst"
3768,"for forms. they are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light,"
3769,to find themselves in things. they will be lured into poets's
3770,"rhymes, they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet"
3771,"planned, they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the"
3772,"future, they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet"
3773,lover's gifts lxx: take back your coins 
3774,"take back your coins, king's councillor. i am of those women you"
3775,sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
3776,seen a women. i failed in your bidding.
3777,dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
3778,"the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a"
3779,"cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of"
3780,sunbeam. we laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped
3781,"into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun"
3782,rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
3783,"like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our"
3784,"movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning"
3785,stars. he lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
3786,"his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest."
3787,never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like
3788,the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. the
3789,"women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with"
3790,"laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. quickly came"
3791,"i to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, i said,"
3792,"""lord, accept my service."""
3793,"i led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of"
3794,"my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, i dried his feet"
3795,with my trailing hair. when i raised my face and looked into his
3796,"eyes, i thought i felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, "
3797,"-blessed am i, blessed is god, who made me a woman. i heard him say"
3798,"to me, ""what god unknown are you? your touch is the touch of the"
3799,"immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight."""
3800,"ah, no, not that smile, king's councillor, -the dust of"
3801,"worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. but this boy's"
3802,"innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman"
3803,"the women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene"
3804,"laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose"
3805,they began to pelt him with flowers.
3806,"alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to"
3807,"cover you in its folds? i fell at his feet and cried, ""forgive me."
3808,""" i fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as"
3809,"i fled, "" forgive me. "" the women's foul laughter pressed me like"
3810,"a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" what god"
3811,"unknown are you?"""
3812,lover's gifts v: i would ask for still more
3813,"i would ask for still more, if i had the sky with all its stars,"
3814,and the world with its endless riches; but i would be content with
3815,the smallest corner of this earth if only she were mine.
3816,lover's gifts viii: there is room for you 
3817,there is room for you. you are alone with your few sheaves of rice.
3818,"my boat is crowded, it is heavily laden, but how can i turn you"
3819,away? your young body is slim and swaying; there is a twinkling
3820,"smile in the edge of your eyes, and your robe is coloured like the"
3821,the travellers will land for different roads and homes. you
3822,"will sit for a while on the prow of my boat, and at the journey's"
3823,end none will keep you back.
3824,"where do you go, and to what home, to garner your sheaves? i"
3825,"will not question you, but when i fold my sails and moor my boat"
3826,"i shall sit and wonder in the evening, -where do you go, and to"
3827,"what home, to garner your sheaves?"
3828,lover's gifts xiii: last night in the garden 
3829,last night in the garden i offered you my youth's foaming wine. you
3830,"lifted the cup to your lips, you shut your eyes and smiled while"
3831,"i raised your veil, unbound your tresses, drawing down upon my"
3832,"breast your face sweet with its silence, last night when the moon's"
3833,dream overflowed the world of slumber.
3834,to-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to
3835,"god's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of"
3836,"flowers in your hand. i stand aside in the shade under the tree,"
3837,"with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to"
3838,lover's gifts xix: it is written in the book 
3839,"it is written in the book that man, when fifty, must leave the"
3840,"noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. but the poet proclaims"
3841,that the forest hermitage is only for the young. for it is the
3842,birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden
3843,hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. there
3844,"the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has"
3845,"its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty."
3846,"and alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is"
3847,"but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the"
3848,young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
3849,discipline of courting.
3850,lover's gifts xl: a message came 
3851,"a message came from my youth of vanished days, saying, "" i wait for"
3852,"you among the quivering of unborn may, where smiles ripen for tears"
3853,"and hours ache with songs unsung."""
3854,"it says, ""come to me across the worn-out track of age, through"
3855,"the gates of death. for dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered"
3856,"fruits of the year decay, but i am the eternal truth, and you shall"
3857,meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to
3858,lover's gifts xlii: are you a mere picture 
3859,"are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as"
3860,"this dust? they throb with the pulse of things, but you are"
3861,"immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form."
3862,"the day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your"
3863,"limbs singing of life. my world found its speech in your voice, and"
3864,"touched my heart with your face. you suddenly stopped in your walk,"
3865,"in the shadow-side of the forever, and i went on alone."
3866,"life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it"
3867,"runs; it beckons me on, i follow the unseen; but you stand there,"
3868,where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a
3869,"no, it cannot be. had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,"
3870,"it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in"
3871,her cadence of colours. had the glimmering dusk of your hair
3872,"vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would"
3873,die with its dreams.
3874,"can it be true that i forgot you? we haste on without heed,"
3875,forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. yet they breathe
3876,"unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. you have"
3877,"moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and"
3878,therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.
3879,"you are no longer before my songs, but one with them. you came"
3880,to me with the first ray of dawn. i lost you with the last gold of
3881,"evening. ever since i am always finding you through the dark. no,"
3882,you are no mere picture.
3883,"lover's gifts xliii: dying, you have left behind "
3884,"dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the eternal"
3885,in my life. you have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset
3886,"colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the"
3887,"earth to love's heaven. clasped in your dear arms, life and death"
3888,united in me in a marriage bond.
3889,i think i can see you watching there in the balcony with your
3890,"lamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet."
3891,my world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding
3892,"the cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own."
3893,lover's gifts xliv: where is heaven 
3894,"where is heaven? you ask me, my child,-the sages tell us it is"
3895,"beyond the limits of birth and death, unswayed by the rhythm of day"
3896,and night; it is not of the earth.
3897,but your poet knows that its eternal hunger is for time and
3898,"space, and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust."
3899,"heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body, my child, in your"
3900,"the sea is beating its drums in joy, the flowers are a-tiptoe"
3901,"to kiss you. for heaven is born in you, in the arms of the mother-"
3902,lover's gifts xlvii: the road is 
3903,the road is my wedded companion. she speaks to me under my feet all
3904,"day, she sings to my dreams all night."
3905,"my meeting with her had no beginning, it begins endlessly at"
3906,"each daybreak, renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs, and"
3907,her every new kiss is the first kiss to me.
3908,the road and i are lovers. i change my dress for her night
3909,"after night, leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside"
3910,inns when the day dawns.
3911,lover's gifts xlviii: i travelled the old road 
3912,"i travelled the old road every day, i took my fruits to the market,"
3913,"my cattle to the meadows, i ferried my boat across the stream and"
3914,all the ways were well known to me.
3915,one morning my basket was heavy with wares. men were busy in
3916,"the fields, the pastures crowded with cattle; the breast of earth"
3917,heaved with the mirth of ripening rice.
3918,"suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to"
3919,kiss me on my forehead. my mind started up like the morning out of
3920,i forgot to follow the track. i stepped a few paces from the
3921,"path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower"
3922,i had only known in bud.
3923,my everyday wisdom was ashamed. i went astray in the fairyland
3924,of things. it was the best luck of my life that i lost my path that
3925,"morning, and found my eternal childhood."
3926,lover's gifts xvi: she dwelt here by the pool 
3927,she dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins. many
3928,an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of
3929,"bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth"
3930,had come to her over the young shoots of rice.
3931,her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and
3932,in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their
3933,winter quilts. the water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory
3934,"of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day"
3935,"after day, on the footpath leading to the village."
3936,the women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have
3937,"all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking"
3938,"his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to"
3939,many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller
3940,takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to
3941,yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice
3942,"this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined"
3943,"landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom i love."
3944,lover's gifts xviii: your days 
3945,"your days will be full of cares, if you must give me your heart."
3946,my house by the cross-roads has its doors open and my mind is
3947,"absent, -for i sing."
3948,"i shall never be made to answer for it, if you must give me"
3949,"your heart. if i pledge my word to you in tunes now, and am too"
3950,"much in earnest to keep it when music is silent, you must forgive"
3951,me; for the law laid down in may is best broken in december.
3952,"do not always keep remembering it, if you must give me your"
3953,"heart. when your eyes sing with love, and your voice ripples with"
3954,"laughter, my answers to your questions will be wild, and not"
3955,"miserly accurate in facts, -they are to be believed for ever and"
3956,then forgotten for good.
3957,lover's gifts xxii: i shall gladly suffer 
3958,"i shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,"
3959,if only in some happy future i am born a herd-boy in the brinda
3960,the herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
3961,"tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to"
3962,splash and plunge in the jamuna's cool deep stream.
3963,"he calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all"
3964,"the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of"
3965,"dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the"
3966,courtyard to milk the king.
3967,"as the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk"
3968,"gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the"
3969,"turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails"
3970,"outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds."
3971,"when the april night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he"
3972,disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the
3973,swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind
3974,"throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks"
3975,of the blue river.
3976,"no, i will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of"
3977,new bengal; i shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
3978,"the benighted. if only i could be born, under the shady asoka"
3979,"groves, in some village of brinda, where milk is churned by the"
3980,lover's gifts xxviii: i dreamt 
3981,"i dreamt that she sat by my head, tenderly ruffling my hair with"
3982,"her fingers, playing the melody of her touch. i looked at her face"
3983,"and struggled with my tears, till the agony of unspoken words burst"
3984,my sleep like a bubble.
3985,"i sat up and saw the glow of the milky way above my window,"
3986,"like a world of silence on fire, and i wondered if at this moment"
3987,she had a dream that rhymed with mine.
3988,lover's gifts xxxix: there is a looker-on 
3989,"things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore, and those"
3990,forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves. he
3991,"has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved, in twilight"
3992,hours of many a nameless star. therefore his sky seems to ache with
3993,"the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades"
3994,"this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of"
3995,ages without beginning.
3996,"that i should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, "
3997,thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance 
3998,---such is thy maya. 
3999,thou settest a barrier in thine own being 
4000,and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. 
4001,this thy self-separation has taken body in me. 
4002,the poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloued tears 
4003,"and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, "
4004,dreams break and form. 
4005,in me is thy own defeat of self. 
4006,this screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures 
4007,with the brush of the night and the day. 
4008,"behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, "
4009,casting away all barren lines of straightness. 
4010,the great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. 
4011,"with the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, "
4012,and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.
4013,moment's indulgence 
4014,i ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. the works 
4015,that i have in hand i will finish afterwards. 
4016,"away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, "
4017,and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. 
4018,today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and
4019,the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. 
4020,"now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing "
4021,dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure
4022,my friend 
4023,art thou abroad on this stormy night 
4024,"on thy journey of love, my friend? "
4025,the sky groans like one in despair. 
4026,i have no sleep tonight. 
4027,ever and again i open my door and look out on 
4028,"the darkness, my friend! "
4029,i can see nothing before me. 
4030,i wonder where lies thy path! 
4031,"by what dim shore of the ink-black river, "
4032,"by what far edge of the frowning forest, "
4033,through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
4034,"thy course to come to me, my friend?"
4035,my song 
4036,"this song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like"
4037,the fond arms of love.
4038,this song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of
4039,when you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in
4040,"your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with"
4041,"my song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will"
4042,transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.
4043,it will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is
4044,over your road.
4045,"my song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry"
4046,your sight into the heart of things.
4047,"and when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in"
4048,your living heart.
4049,o fool 
4050,"o fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! "
4051,"o beggar, to come beg at thy own door! "
4052,"leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, "
4053,and never look behind in regret. 
4054,thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.
4055,it is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. 
4056,accept only what is offered by sacred love.
4057,ocean of forms 
4058,"i dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, "
4059,hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless. 
4060,no more sailing from harbor to harbor with this my weather-beaten boat. 
4061,the days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves. 
4062,and now i am eager to die into the deathless. 
4063,into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss 
4064,where swells up the music of toneless strings 
4065,i shall take this harp of my life. 
4066,"i shall tune it to the notes of forever, "
4067,"and when it has sobbed out its last utterance, "
4068,lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent.
4069,old and new 
4070,thou hast made me known to friends whom i knew not. 
4071,thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. 
4072,thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. 
4073,i am uneasy at heart when i have to leave my accustomed shelter; 
4074,"i forget that there abides the old in the new, "
4075,and that there also thou abidest. 
4076,"through birth and death, in this world or in others, "
4077,"wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, "
4078,the one companion of my endless life 
4079,who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. 
4080,"when one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. "
4081,"oh, grant me my prayer that i may never lose "
4082,the bliss of the touch of the one 
4083,in the play of many.
4084,on the seashore 
4085,on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. 
4086,the infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. on the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances. 
4087,"they build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. with withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. children have their play on the seashore of worlds. "
4088,"they know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. "
4089,"the sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. the sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. "
4090,"on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. on the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children."
4091,only thee 
4092,"that i want thee, only thee---let my heart repeat without end. "
4093,"all desires that distract me, day and night, "
4094,are false and empty to the core. 
4095,"as the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, "
4096,even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry 
4097,"---`i want thee, only thee'. "
4098,as the storm still seeks its end in peace 
4099,"when it strikes against peace with all its might, "
4100,even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love 
4101,and still its cry is 
4102,"---`i want thee, only thee'."
4103,paper boats 
4104,day by day i float my paper boats one by one down the running
4105,in bid black letters i write my name on them and the name of
4106,the village where i live.
4107,i hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
4108,know who i am.
4109,"i load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and"
4110,hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
4111,in the night.
4112,i launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
4113,little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
4114,i know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
4115,the air to race with my boats!
4116,when night comes i bury my face in my arms and dream that my
4117,paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
4118,"the fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins"
4119,their baskets full of dreams.
4120,parting words 
4121,when i go from hence 
4122,"let this be my parting word, "
4123,that what i have seen is unsurpassable. 
4124,i have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus 
4125,"that expands on the ocean of light, "
4126,and thus am i blessed 
4127,---let this be my parting word. 
4128,in this playhouse of infinite forms 
4129,i have had my play 
4130,and here have i caught sight of him that is formless. 
4131,my whole body and my limbs 
4132,have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch; 
4133,"and if the end comes here, let it come "
4134,---let this be my parting word.
4135,passing breeze 
4136,"yes, i know, this is nothing but thy love, "
4137,"o beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves, "
4138,"these idle clouds sailing across the sky, "
4139,this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. 
4140,the morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart. 
4141,"thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, "
4142,and my heart has touched thy feet.
4143,patience by rabindranath tagore
4144,if thou speakest not i will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. 
4145,i will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil 
4146,and its head bent low with patience. 
4147,"the morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, "
4148,and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky. 
4149,"then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, "
4150,and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.
4151,"child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning. "
4152,i smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig. 
4153,"i am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour. "
4154,"perhaps you glance at me and think, ""what a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"" "
4155,"child, i have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies. "
4156,"i seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. "
4157,"with whatever you find you create your glad games, i spend both my time and my strength over things i never can obtain. "
4158,"in my frail canoe i struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that i too am playing a game."
4159,"`prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?' "
4160,"`it was my master,' said the prisoner. "
4161,"`i thought i could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, "
4162,and i amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. 
4163,"when sleep overcame me i lay upon the bed that was for my lord, "
4164,and on waking up i found i was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' 
4165,"`prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?' "
4166,"`it was i,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. "
4167,i thought my invincible power would hold the world captive 
4168,leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. 
4169,thus night and day i worked at the chain 
4170,with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. 
4171,when at last the work was done 
4172,"and the links were complete and unbreakable, "
4173,i found that it held me in its grip.'
4174,"life of my life, i shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing "
4175,that thy living touch is upon all my limbs. 
4176,"i shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing "
4177,that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind. 
4178,i shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my 
4179,"love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart. "
4180,"and it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it "
4181,is thy power gives me strength to act.
4182,roaming cloud 
4183,i am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn 
4184,"uselessly roaming in the sky, o my sun ever-glorious! "
4185,"thy touch has not yet melted my vapor, "
4186,"making me one with thy light, "
4187,and thus i count months and years separated from thee. 
4188,"if this be thy wish and if this be thy play, "
4189,"then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, "
4190,"paint it with colors, gild it with gold, "
4191,float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders. 
4192,"and again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, "
4193,"i shall melt and vanish away in the dark, "
4194,"or it may be in a smile of the white morning, "
4195,in a coolness of purity transparent.
4196,sail away 
4197,"early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, "
4198,"only thou and i, and never a soul in the world would know of this our "
4199,pilgrimage to no country and to no end. 
4200,"in that shoreless ocean, "
4201,"at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, "
4202,"free as waves, free from all bondage of words. "
4203,is the time not come yet? 
4204,are there works still to do? 
4205,"lo, the evening has come down upon the shore "
4206,and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests. 
4207,"who knows when the chains will be off, "
4208,"and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, "
4209,vanish into the night?
4210,"in one salutation to thee, my god, "
4211,let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet. 
4212,like a rain-cloud of july 
4213,hung low with its burden of unshed showers 
4214,let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee. 
4215,let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current 
4216,and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee. 
4217,like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day 
4218,back to their mountain nests 
4219,let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home 
4220,in one salutation to thee.
4221,on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. 
4222,the infinite sky is motionless overhead 
4223,and the restless water is boisterous. 
4224,on the seashore of endless worlds 
4225,the children meet with shouts and dances. 
4226,they build their houses with sand 
4227,and they play with empty shells. 
4228,with withered leaves they weave their boats 
4229,and smilingly float them on the vast deep. 
4230,children have their play on the seashore of worlds. 
4231,"they know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. "
4232,"pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, "
4233,while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. 
4234,"they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. "
4235,the sea surges up with laughter 
4236,and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. 
4237,"death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, "
4238,even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. 
4239,"the sea plays with children, "
4240,and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. 
4241,on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. 
4242,"tempest roams in the pathless sky, "
4243,"ships get wrecked in the trackless water, "
4244,death is abroad and children play. 
4245,on the seashore of endless worlds is the 
4246,great meeting of children.
4247,deliverance is not for me in renunciation. 
4248,i feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight. 
4249,thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various 
4250,"colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim. "
4251,my world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame 
4252,and place them before the altar of thy temple. 
4253,"no, i will never shut the doors of my senses. "
4254,the delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight. 
4255,"yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, "
4256,and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.
4257,"she who ever had remained in the depth of my being, "
4258,in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; 
4259,"she who never opened her veils in the morning light, "
4260,"will be my last gift to thee, my god, folded in my final song. "
4261,words have wooed yet failed to win her; 
4262,persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain. 
4263,"i have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, "
4264,and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life. 
4265,"over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, "
4266,she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart. 
4267,many a man knocked at my door and asked for her 
4268,and turned away in despair. 
4269,"there was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, "
4270,and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.
4271,signet of eternity 
4272,the day was when i did not keep myself in readiness for thee; 
4273,"and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, "
4274,"unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon "
4275,many a fleeting moment of my life. 
4276,"and today when by chance i light upon them and see thy signature, "
4277,i find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of 
4278,joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten. 
4279,"thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, "
4280,and the steps that i heard in my playroom 
4281,are the same that are echoing from star to star.
4282,silent steps 
4283,have you not heard his silent steps? 
4284,"he comes, comes, ever comes. "
4285,"every moment and every age, "
4286,"every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes. "
4287,"many a song have i sung in many a mood of mind, "
4288,"but all their notes have always proclaimed, "
4289,"`he comes, comes, ever comes.' "
4290,"in the fragrant days of sunny april through the forest path he comes, "
4291,"comes, ever comes. "
4292,in the rainy gloom of july nights on the thundering chariot of clouds 
4293,"he comes, comes, ever comes. "
4294,"in sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, "
4295,and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine.
4296,sit smiling 
4297,i boasted among men that i had known you. 
4298,they see your pictures in all works of mine. 
4299,"they come and ask me, `who is he?' "
4300,"i know not how to answer them. i say, `indeed, i cannot tell.' "
4301,they blame me and they go away in scorn. 
4302,and you sit there smiling. 
4303,i put my tales of you into lasting songs. 
4304,the secret gushes out from my heart. 
4305,"they come and ask me, `tell me all your meanings.' "
4306,i know not how to answer them. 
4307,"i say, `ah, who knows what they mean!' "
4308,they smile and go away in utter scorn. 
4309,and you sit there smiling
4310,in the night of weariness 
4311,"let me give myself up to sleep without struggle, "
4312,resting my trust upon thee. 
4313,let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship. 
4314,it is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day 
4315,to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening.
4316,song unsung by rabindranath tagore
4317,the song that i came to sing remains unsung to this day. 
4318,i have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. 
4319,"the time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; "
4320,only there is the agony of wishing in my heart. 
4321,the blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. 
4322,"i have not seen his face, nor have i listened to his voice; "
4323,only i have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house. 
4324,the livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; 
4325,but the lamp has not been lit and i cannot ask him into my house. 
4326,i live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.
4327,still heart 
4328,when i give up the helm 
4329,i know that the time has come for thee to take it. 
4330,what there is to do will be instantly done. 
4331,vain is this struggle. 
4332,then take away your hands 
4333,"and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, "
4334,and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still 
4335,where you are placed. 
4336,"these my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, "
4337,and trying to light them i forget all else again and again. 
4338,"but i shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, "
4339,spreading my mat on the floor; 
4340,"and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, "
4341,come silently and take thy seat here.
4342,stream of life
4343,the same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day 
4344,runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. 
4345,it is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth 
4346,in numberless blades of grass 
4347,and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers. 
4348,it is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth 
4349,"and of death, in ebb and in flow. "
4350,i feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. 
4351,and my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment
4352,"my desires are many and my cry is pitiful, "
4353,but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; 
4354,and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through. 
4355,"day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, "
4356,"great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the "
4357,life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire. 
4358,there are times when i languidly linger 
4359,and times when i awaken and hurry in search of my goal; 
4360,but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. 
4361,day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by 
4362,"refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire."
4363,"mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!"
4364,she does not know the difference between the lights in the
4365,streets and the stars.
4366,"when we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real"
4367,"food, and tries to put them into her mouth."
4368,"when i open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,"
4369,"c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at"
4370,nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson.
4371,when i shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
4372,"her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun."
4373,"everybody knows that father is away, but if in play i call"
4374,"aloud ""father,"" she looks about her in excitement and thinks that"
4375,father is near.
4376,when i hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man
4377,brings to carry away the clothes and i warn her that i am the
4378,"schoolmaster, she will scream for no reason and call me dada."
4379,your baby wants to catch the moon. she is so funny; she calls
4380,"mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!"
4381,"if i were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would"
4382,"you say ""no"" to me if i tried to eat from your dish?"
4383,"would you drive me off, saying to me, ""get away, you naughty"
4384,"then go, mother, go! i will never come to you when you call"
4385,"me, and never let you feed me any more."
4386,"if i were only a little green parrot, and not your baby,"
4387,"mother dear, would you keep me chained lest i should fly away?"
4388,"would you shake your finger at me and say, ""what an ungrateful"
4389,"wretch of a bird! it is gnawing at its chain day and night?"""
4390,"the go, mother, go! i will run away into the woods; i will"
4391,never let you take me in your arms again.
4392,the astronomer 
4393,"i only said, ""when in the evening the round full moon gets"
4394,"entangled among the beaches of that dadam tree, couldn't somebody"
4395,"but dada laughed at me and said, ""baby, you are the silliest"
4396,"child i have ever known. the moon is ever so far from us, how could"
4397,"anybody catch it?"""
4398,"i said, ""dada, how foolish you are! when mother looks out of"
4399,"her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far"
4400,"still dada said, ""you are a stupid child! but, baby where"
4401,"could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?"""
4402,"i said, ""surely you could catch it with your hands."""
4403,"but dada laughed and said, ""you are the silliest child i have"
4404,"known. if it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is."""
4405,"i said, ""dada, what nonsense they teach at your school! when"
4406,"mother bends her face down to kiss us, does her face look very"
4407,"but still dada says, ""you are a stupid child."""
4408,the banyan tree 
4409,"o you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,"
4410,"have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have"
4411,nested in your branches and left you?
4412,do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
4413,the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?
4414,"the women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your"
4415,huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
4416,to wake up.
4417,sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
4418,weaving golden tapestry.
4419,"two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and"
4420,the child would sit still and think.
4421,he longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
4422,"branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,"
4423,"to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like"
4424,those ducks among the weeds and shadows.
4425,the beginning 
4426,"""where have i come from, where did you pick me up?"" the baby asked"
4427,"she answered, half crying, half laughing, and clasping the"
4428,baby to her breast-
4429,"""you were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling."
4430,you were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with
4431,"clay i made the image of my god every morning, i made the unmade"
4432,"you were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship"
4433,i worshipped you.
4434,"in all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my"
4435,mother you have lived.
4436,in the lap of the deathless spirit who rules our home you have
4437,been nursed for ages.
4438,"when in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered"
4439,as a fragrance about it.
4440,"your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow"
4441,in the sky before the sunrise.
4442,"heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you"
4443,"have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you"
4444,have stranded on my heart.
4445,"as i gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong"
4446,to all have become mine.
4447,for fear of losing you i hold you tight to my breast. what
4448,magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
4449,the boat 
4450,i must launch out my boat. 
4451,the languid hours pass by on the 
4452,shore---alas for me! 
4453,the spring has done its flowering and taken leave. 
4454,and now with the burden of faded futile flowers i wait and linger. 
4455,"the waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane "
4456,the yellow leaves flutter and fall. 
4457,what emptiness do you gaze upon! 
4458,do you not feel a thrill passing through the air 
4459,with the notes of the far-away song 
4460,floating from the other shore?
4461,the chanpa flower 
4462,"supposing i became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a"
4463,"branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and"
4464,"danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?"
4465,"you would call, ""baby, where are you?"" and i should laugh to"
4466,myself and keep quite quiet.
4467,i should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.
4468,"when after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,"
4469,you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
4470,"where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the"
4471,"flower, but not know that it cane from me."
4472,when after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
4473,"ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,"
4474,"i should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,"
4475,just where you were reading.
4476,but would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
4477,when in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
4478,lamp in your hand i should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
4479,"be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story."
4480,"""where have you been, you naughty child?"""
4481,"""i won't tell you, mother."" that's what you and i would say"
4482,the child-angel 
4483,"they clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end"
4484,to their wrangling.
4485,"let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my"
4486,"child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence."
4487,"they are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like"
4488,hidden knives thirsting for blood.
4489,"go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let"
4490,your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the
4491,evening over the strife of the day.
4492,"let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning"
4493,of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.
4494,"come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my"
4495,child. at sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming
4496,"flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the"
4497,worship of the day.
4498,the end 
4499,"it is time for me to go, mother; i am going."
4500,when in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
4501,"your arms for your baby in the bed, i shall say, ""baby is not"
4502,"here!""-mother, i am going."
4503,i shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and
4504,"i shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and"
4505,kiss you again.
4506,in the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you
4507,"will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with"
4508,the lightning through the open window into your room.
4509,"if you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the"
4510,"night, i shall sing to you from the stars, ""sleep, mother, sleep."""
4511,"one the straying moonbeams i shall steal over your bed, and"
4512,lie upon your bosom while you sleep.
4513,"i shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your"
4514,eyelids i shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you
4515,"wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly i shall"
4516,flit out into the darkness.
4517,"when, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children"
4518,"come and play about the house, i shall melt into the music of the"
4519,flute and throb in your heart all day.
4520,"dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""where"
4521,"is our baby, sister?"" mother, you will tell her softly, ""he is in"
4522,"the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul."
4523,the first jasmines 
4524,"ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!"
4525,i seem to remember the first day when i filled my hands with
4526,"these jasmines, these white jasmines."
4527,"i have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;"
4528,i have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
4529,darkness of midnight;
4530,autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
4531,"lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover."
4532,yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
4533,that i held in my hands when i was a child.
4534,"many a glad day has come in my life, and i have laughed with"
4535,merrymakers on festival nights.
4536,on grey mornings of rain i have crooned many an idle song.
4537,i have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
4538,by the hand of love.
4539,yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh
4540,jasmines that filled my hands when i was a child.
4541,the flower-school 
4542,when storm-clouds rumble in the sky and june showers come down.
4543,the moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
4544,bagpipes among the bamboos.
4545,"then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows"
4546,"where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee."
4547,"mother, i really think the flowers go to school underground."
4548,"they do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to"
4549,"come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand"
4550,in a corner.
4551,when the rain come they have their holidays.
4552,"branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle"
4553,"in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the"
4554,flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.
4555,"do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars"
4556,haven't you see how eager they are to get there? don't you
4557,know why they are in such a hurry?
4558,"of course, i can guess to whom they raise their arms; they"
4559,have their mother as i have my own.
4560, the further bank 
4561,i long to go over there to the further bank of the river.
4562,where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;
4563,where men cross over in their boats in the morning with
4564,ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;
4565,where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the
4566,"whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the"
4567,jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds.
4568,"mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
4569,of the ferry when i am grown up.
4570,they say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank.
4571,"where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and"
4572,thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their
4573,where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny
4574,footprints upon the clean soft mud;
4575,where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while
4576,flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.
4577,"mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
4578,of the ferryboat when i am grown up.
4579,"i shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the"
4580,boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are
4581,"when the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon,"
4582,"i shall come running to you, saying, ""mother, i am hungry."""
4583,"when the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees,"
4584,i shall come back in the dust.
4585,i shall never go away from you into the town to work like
4586,"mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
4587,of the ferryboat when i am grown up.
4588,the gardener iv: ah me 
4589,"ah me, why did they build my"
4590,house by the road to the market
4591,they moor their laden boats near
4592,they come and go and wander at
4593,i sit and watch them; my time
4594,turn them away i cannot. and
4595,thus my days pass by.
4596,night and day their steps sound
4597,by my door.
4598,"vainly i cry, ""i do not know"
4599,some of them are known to my
4600,"fingers, some to my nostrils, the"
4601,blood in my veins seems to know
4602,"them, and some are known to my"
4603,turn them away i cannot. i call
4604,"them and say, ""come to my house"
4605,"whoever chooses. yes, come."""
4606,in the morning the bell rings in the
4607,they come with their baskets in
4608,their feet are rosy red. the early
4609,light of dawn is on their faces.
4610,turn them away i cannot. i call
4611,"them and i say, ""come to my garden"
4612,"to gather flowers. come hither."""
4613,in the mid-day the gong sounds 
4614,at the palace gate.
4615,i know not why they leave their 
4616,work and linger near my hedge.
4617,the flowers in their hair are pale
4618,and faded; the notes are languid in
4619,turn them away i cannot. i call 
4620,"them and say, ""the shade is cool"
4621,"under my trees. come, friends."""
4622,at night the crickets chirp in the
4623,who is it that comes slowly to my
4624,door and gently knocks?
4625,"i vaguely see the face, not a word"
4626,"is spoken, the stillness of the sky is"
4627,turn away my silent guest i
4628,cannot. i look at the face through the
4629,"dark, and hours of dreams pass by."
4630,the gardener ix: when i go alone at night 
4631,when i go alone at night to my
4632,"love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind"
4633,"does not stir, the houses on both sides"
4634,of the street stand silent.
4635,it is my own anklets that grow loud 
4636,at every step and i am ashamed.
4637,when i sit on my balcony and listen
4638,"for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle"
4639,"on the trees, and the water is still in"
4640,the river like the sword on the knees
4641,of a sentry fallen asleep.
4642,it is my own heart that beats wildly
4643,--i do not know how to quiet it.
4644,when my love comes and sits by
4645,"my side, when my body trembles and"
4646,"my eyelids droop, the night darkens,"
4647,"the wind blows out the lamp, and the"
4648,clouds draw veils over the stars.
4649,it is the jewel at my own breast
4650,that shines and gives light. i do not
4651,know how to hide it.
4652,the gardener li: then finish the last song 
4653,then finish the last song and let us
4654,forget this night when the night is
4655,whom do i try to clasp in my
4656,arms? dreams can never be made captive.
4657,my eager hands press emptiness to
4658,my heart and it bruises my breast.
4659,the gardener lix: o woman 
4660,"o woman, you are not merely the"
4661,"handiwork of god, but also of men;"
4662,these are ever endowing you with
4663,beauty from their hearts.
4664,poets are weaving for you a web
4665,with threads of golden imagery;
4666,painters are giving your form ever
4667,"the sea gives its pearls, the mines"
4668,"their gold, the summer gardens their"
4669,"flowers to deck you, to cover you, to"
4670,make you more precious.
4671,the desire of men's hearts has shed
4672,its glory over your youth.
4673,you are one half woman and one
4674,the gardener lv: it was mid-day 
4675,it was mid-day when you went 
4676,the sun was strong in the sky.
4677,i had done my work and sat alone
4678,on my balcony when you went away.
4679,fitful gusts came winnowing
4680,through the smells of may distant
4681,"the doves cooed tireless in the shade,"
4682,and a bee strayed in my room hum-
4683,ming the news of many distant fields.
4684,the village slept in the noonday
4685,heat. the road lay deserted.
4686,in sudden fits the rustling of the
4687,leaves rose and died.
4688,i gazed at the sky and wove in the 
4689,"blue the letters of a name i had known,"
4690,while the village slept in the noonday
4691,i had forgotten to braid my hair.
4692,the languid breeze played with it upon
4693,the river ran unruffled under the
4694,the lazy white clouds did not move.
4695,i had forgotten to braid my hair.
4696,it was mid-day when you went 
4697,the dust of the road was hot and
4698,the fields panting.
4699,the doves cooed among the dense
4700,i was alone in my balcony when you
4701,"the gardener lxi: peace, my heart "
4702,"peace, my heart, let the time for"
4703,the parting be sweet.
4704,let it not be a death but completeness.
4705,let love melt into memory and pain
4706,let the flight through the sky end
4707,in the folding of the wings over the
4708,let the last touch of your hands be
4709,gentle like the flower of the night.
4710,"stand still, o beautiful end, for a"
4711,"moment, and say your last words in"
4712,i bow to you and hold up my lamp 
4713,to light you on your way.
4714,the gardener lxiv: i spent my day 
4715,i spent my day on the scorching
4716,hot dust of the road.
4717,"now, in the cool of the evening, i"
4718,knock at the door of the inn. it is 
4719,deserted and in ruins.
4720,a grim ashath tree spreads its 
4721,hungry clutching roots through the
4722,gaping fissures of the walls.
4723,days have been when wayfarers
4724,came here to wash their weary feet.
4725,they spread their mats in the 
4726,courtyard in the dim light of the
4727,"early moon, and sat and talked of"
4728,they woke refreshed in the morning
4729,"when birds made them glad, and "
4730,friendly flowers nodded their heads 
4731,at them from the wayside.
4732,but no lighted lamp awaited me
4733,when i came here.
4734,the black smudges of smoke left by
4735,"many a forgotten evening lamp stare,"
4736,"like blind eyes, from the wall."
4737,fireflies flit in the bush near the
4738,"dried-up pond, and bamboo branches"
4739,fling their shadows on the grass-
4740,i am the guest of no one at the end
4741,of my day.
4742,"the long night is before me, and i"
4743,the gardener lxix: i hunt for the golden stag 
4744,i hunt for the golden stag.
4745,"you may smile, my friends, but i"
4746,pursue the vision that eludes me.
4747,"i run across hills and dales, i wander"
4748,"through nameless lands, because i am"
4749,hunting for the golden stag.
4750,you come and buy in the market
4751,and go back to your homes laden with
4752,"goods, but the spell of the homeless"
4753,winds has touched me i know not when
4754,i have no care in my heart; all my
4755,belongings i have left far behind me.
4756,"i run across hills and dales, i wander"
4757,through nameless lands--because i am
4758,hunting for the golden stag.
4759,"the gardener lxviii: none lives for ever, brother "
4760,"none lives for ever, brother, and"
4761,nothing lasts for long. keep that in
4762,mind and rejoice.
4763,"our life is not the one old burden,"
4764,our path is not the one long
4765,one sole poet has not to sing one
4766,the flower fades and dies; but he
4767,who wears the flower has not to
4768,mourn for it for ever.
4769,"brother, keep that in mind and "
4770,there must come a full pause to
4771,weave perfection into music.
4772,life droops toward its sunset to be
4773,drowned in the golden shadows.
4774,love must be called from its play
4775,to drink sorrow and be borne to the
4776,heaven of tears.
4777,"brother, keep that in min and"
4778,we hasten to gather our flowers lest
4779,they are plundered by the passing
4780,it quickens our blood and brightens 
4781,our eyes to snatch kisses that would
4782,vanish if we delayed.
4783,"our life is eager, our desires are keen,"
4784,for time tolls the bell of parting.
4785,"brother, keep that in mind and"
4786,there is not time for us to clasp a
4787,thing and crush it and fling it away to
4788,"the hours trip rapidly away, hiding"
4789,their dreams in their skirts.
4790,our life is short; it yields but a
4791,few days for love.
4792,were it for work and drudgery it
4793,would be endlessly long.
4794,"brother, keep that in mind and"
4795,"beauty is sweet to us, because she"
4796,dances to the same fleeting tune with
4797,"knowledge is precious to us, because"
4798,we shall never have time to
4799,all is done and finished in the eternal
4800,but earth's flowers of illusion are
4801,kept eternally fresh by death.
4802,"brother, keep that in mind and"
4803,the gardener lxxv: at midnight 
4804,at midnight the would-be ascetic
4805,"""this is the time to give up my"
4806,"home and seek for god. ah, who has"
4807,"held me so long in delusion here?"""
4808,"god whispered, ""i,"" but the ears"
4809,of the man were stopped.
4810,with a baby asleep at her breast
4811,"lay his wife, peacefully sleeping on"
4812,one side of the bed.
4813,"the man said, ""who are ye that"
4814,"have fooled me so long?"""
4815,"the voice said again, ""they are"
4816,"god,"" but he heard it not."
4817,"the baby cried out in its dream,"
4818,nestling close to its mother.
4819,"god commanded, ""stop, fool, leave"
4820,"not thy home,"" but still he heard not."
4821,"god sighed and complained, ""why"
4822,"does my servant wander to seek me,"
4823,the gardener lxxvi: the fair was on 
4824,the fair was on before the temple.
4825,it had rained from the early morning
4826,and the day came to its end.
4827,brighter than all the gladness of
4828,the crowd was the bright smile of
4829,a girl who bought for a farthing a 
4830,whistle of palm leaf.
4831,the shrill joy of that whistle floated
4832,above all laughter and noise.
4833,an endless throng of people came
4834,and jostled together. the road was
4835,"muddy, the river in flood, the field"
4836,under water in ceaseless rain.
4837,greater than all the troubles of
4838,the crowd was a little boy's trouble--
4839,he had not a farthing to buy a painted
4840,his wistful eyes gazing at the shop
4841,made this whole meeting of men so
4842,the gardener lxxxi: why do you whisper so faintly 
4843,why do you whisper so faintly in
4844,"my ears, o death, my death?"
4845,when the flowers droop in the
4846,evening and cattle come back to their
4847,"stalls, you stealthily come to my side"
4848,and speak words that i do not
4849,is this how you must woo and win
4850,me with the opiate of drowsy murmur
4851,"and cold kisses, o death, my death?"
4852,will there be no proud ceremony
4853,for our wedding?
4854,will you not tie up with a wreath
4855,your tawny coiled locks?
4856,is there none to carry your banner
4857,"before you, and will not the night be"
4858,"on fire with your red torch-lights,"
4859,"o death, my death?"
4860,come with your conch-shells sound-
4861,"ing, come in the sleepless night."
4862,"dress me with a crimson mantle,"
4863,grasp my hand and take me.
4864,let your chariot be ready at my
4865,door with your horses neighing impatiently.
4866,raise my veil and look at my face
4867,"proudly, o death, my death!"
4868,the gardener lxxxiii: she dwelt on the hillside
4869,she dwelt on the hillside by edge
4870,"of a maize-field, near the spring that"
4871,flows in laughing rills through the
4872,solemn shadows of ancient trees. the
4873,"women came there to fill their jars,"
4874,and travellers would sit there to rest
4875,and talk. she worked and dreamed 
4876,daily to the tune of the bubbling
4877,one evening the stranger came down
4878,from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks
4879,were tangled like drowsy snakes. we
4880,"asked in wonder, ""who are you?"""
4881,he answered not but sat by the
4882,garrulous stream and silently gazed at
4883,the hut where she dwelt. our hearts 
4884,quaked in fear and we came back home
4885,when it was night.
4886,next morning when the women
4887,came to fetch water at the spring by
4888,"the deodar trees, they found the doors "
4889,"open in her hut, but her voice was gone"
4890,and where was her smiling face?
4891,the empty jar lay on the floor and her
4892,lamp had burnt itself out in the
4893,corner. no one knew where she had
4894,fled to before it was morning--and the
4895,stranger had gone.
4896,in the month of may the sun grew
4897,"strong and the snow melted, and we"
4898,sat by the spring and wept. we 
4899,"wondered in our mind, ""is there a"
4900,spring in the land where she has gone
4901,and where she can fill her vessel in
4902,"these hot thirsty days?"" and we"
4903,"asked each other in dismay, ""is there"
4904,a land beyond these hills where we
4905,it was a summer night; the breeze
4906,blew from the south; and i sat in her
4907,deserted room where the lamp stood
4908,still unlit. when suddenly from
4909,before my eyes the hills vanished like
4910,"curtains drawn aside. ""ah, it is"
4911,"she who comes. how are you, my"
4912,child? are you happy? but where
4913,can you shelter under this open sky?
4914,"and, alas! our spring is not here to"
4915,"allay your thirst."""
4916,"""here is the same sky,"" she said,"
4917,"""only free from the fencing hills,--"
4918,this is the same stream grown into a
4919,"river,--the same earth widened into"
4920,"a plain."" ""everything is here,"" i"
4921,"sighed, ""only we are not."" she"
4922,"smiled sadly and said, ""you are in"
4923,"my heart."" i woke up and heard the"
4924,babbling of the stream and the rustling
4925,of the deodars at night.
4926,the gardener lxxxiv: over the green 
4927,over the green and yellow rice-fields
4928,sweep the shadows of the autumn
4929,clouds followed by the swift-chasing
4930,the bees forget to sip their honey;
4931,drunken with light they foolishly hover
4932,the ducks in the islands of the river
4933,clamour in joy for mere nothing.
4934,"let none go back home, brothers,"
4935,"this morning, let none go to work."
4936,let us take the blue sky by storm
4937,and plunder space as we run.
4938,laughter floats in the air like foam
4939,on the flood.
4940,"brothers, let us squander our"
4941,morning in futile songs.
4942,"the gardener x: let your work be, bride "
4943,"let your work be, bride. listen, the"
4944,guest has come.
4945,"do you hear, he is gently shaking"
4946,the chain which fastens the door?
4947,see that your anklets make no loud 
4948,"noise, and that your step is not over-"
4949,hurried at meeting him.
4950,"let your work be, bride, the guest"
4951,had come in the evening.
4952,"no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride,"
4953,do not be frightened.
4954,it is the full moon on a night of
4955,april; shadows are pale in the court-
4956,yard; the sky overhead is bright.
4957,draw your veil over your face if
4958,"you must, carry the lamp to the door"
4959,if you fear.
4960,"no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, "
4961,do not be frightened.
4962,have no word with him if you are
4963,shy; stand aside by the door when you
4964,"if he asks you questions, and if"
4965,"you wish to, you can lower you eyes"
4966,do not let your bracelets jingle
4967,"when, lamp in hand, you lead him in."

4969,"have you not finished you work yet,"
4970,"bride? listen, the guest has come."
4971,have you not lit the lamp in the
4972,have you not got ready the offering
4973,basket for the evening service?
4974,have you not put the red lucky
4975,"mark at the parting of your hair, and"
4976,done your toilet for the night?
4977,"o bride, do you hear, the guest has"

4979,the gardener xiii: i asked nothing 
4980,"i asked nothing, only stood at the "
4981,edge of the wood behind the tree.
4982,languor was still upon the eyes
4983,"of the dawn, and the dew in the air."
4984,the lazy smell of the damp grass
4985,hung in the thin mist above the earth.
4986,under the banyan tree you were
4987,"milking the cow with your hands,"
4988,tender and fresh as butter.
4989,and i was standing still.
4990,i did not say a word. it was the
4991,bird that sang unseen from the thicket.
4992,the mango tree was shedding its
4993,"flowers upon the village road, and the "
4994,bees came humming one by one.
4995,on the side of the pond the gate of 
4996,shiva's temple was opened and the
4997,worshipper had begun his chants.
4998,with the vessel on your lap you
4999,were milking the cow.
5000,i stood with my empty can.
5001,i did not come near you.
5002,the sky woke with the sound of
5003,the gong at the temple.
5004,the dust was raised in the road
5005,from the hoofs of the driven cattle.
5006,with the gurgling pitchers at their 
5007,"hips, women came from the river."
5008,"your bracelets were jingling, and "
5009,foam brimming over the jar.
5010,the morning wore on and i did not
5011,come near you.
5012,the gardener xiv: i was walking by the road 
5013,"i was walking by the road, i do not"
5014,"know why, when the noonday was past"
5015,and bamboo branches rustled in the
5016,the prone shadows with their out-
5017,stretched arms clung to the feet of
5018,the hurrying light.
5019,the koels were weary of their

5021,the hut by the side of the water is
5022,shaded by an overhanging tree.
5023,"some on was busy with her work,"
5024,and her bangles made music in the
5025,"i stood before this hut, i know not"
5026,the narrow winding road crosses
5027,"many a mustard field, and many a"
5028,it passes by the temple of the
5029,village and the market at the river
5030,"i stopped by this hut, i do not know"
5031,years ago it was a day of breezy
5032,march when the murmur of the spring
5033,"was languorous, and mango blossoms"
5034,were dropping on the dust.
5035,the rippling water leapt and licked
5036,the brass vessel that stood on the 
5037,"i think of that day of breezy march,"
5038,i do not know why.
5039,shadows are deepening and cattle 
5040,returning to their folds.
5041,the light is grey upon the lonely
5042,"meadows, and the villagers are waiting"
5043,for the ferry at the bank.
5044,"i slowly return upon my steps, i"
5045,do not know why.
5046,the gardener xix: you walked 
5047,you walked by the riverside path
5048,with the full pitcher upon your hip.
5049,why did you swiftly turn your face
5050,and peep at me through your fluttering
5051,that gleaming look from the dark
5052,came upon me like a breeze that sends 
5053,a shiver through the rippling water
5054,and sweeps away to the shadowy
5055,it came to me like the bird of the
5056,evening that hurriedly flies across the
5057,lampless room from the one open 
5058,"window to the other, and disappears"
5059,in the night.
5060,you are hidden as a star behind the
5061,"hills, and i am a passer-by upon the "
5062,but why did you stop for a moment
5063,and glance at my face through your
5064,veil while you walked by the river-
5065,side path with the full pitcher upon
5066,the gardener xl: an unbelieving smile 
5067,an unbelieving smile flits on your
5068,eyes when i come to you to take my
5069,i have done it so often that you
5070,think i will soon return.
5071,to tell you the truth i have the
5072,same doubt in my mind.
5073,for the spring days come again 
5074,time after time; the full moon takes
5075,"leave and comes on another visit,"
5076,the flowers come again and blush
5077,"upon their branches year after year,"
5078,and it is likely that i take my leave
5079,only to come to you again.
5080,but keep the illusion awhile; do
5081,not send it away with ungentle
5082,when i say i leave you for all 
5083,"time, accept it as true, and let a"
5084,mist of tears for one moment deepen
5085,the dark rim of your eyes.
5086,then smile as archly as you like
5087,when i come again.
5088,"the gardener xlii: o mad, superbly drunk "
5089,"o mad, superbly drunk;"
5090,if you kick open your doors and
5091,play the fool in public;
5092,"if you empty your bag in a night, "
5093,and snap your fingers at prudence;
5094,if you walk in curious paths and
5095,play with useless things;
5096,reck not rhyme or reason;
5097,if unfurling your sails before the
5098,"storm you snap the rudder in two,"
5099,"then i will follow you, comrade,"
5100,and be drunken and go to the dogs.
5101,i have wasted my days and nights
5102,in the company of steady wise neighbours.
5103,much knowing has turned my hair
5104,"grey, and much watching has made "
5105,my sight dim.
5106,for years i have gathered and
5107,heaped up scraps and fragments of
5108,"crush them and dance upon them,"
5109,and scatter them all to the winds.
5110,for i know 'tis the height of wisdom
5111,to be drunken and go the dogs.
5112,"let all crooked scruples vanish,"
5113,let me hopelessly lose my way.
5114,let a gust of wild giddiness come
5115,and sweep me away from my anchors.
5116,"the world is peopled with worthies,"
5117,"and workers, useful and clever."
5118,"there are men who are easily first,"
5119,and men who come decently after.
5120,"let them be happy and prosper, "
5121,and let me be foolishly futile.
5122,for i know 'tis the end of all works
5123,to be drunken and go to the dogs.
5124,i swear to surrender this moment
5125,all claims to the ranks of the decent.
5126,i let go my pride of learning and
5127,judgment of right and of wrong.
5128,"i'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering"
5129,the last drop of tears.
5130,with the foam of the berry-red
5131,wine i will bathe and brighten my 
5132,the badge of the civil and staid
5133,i'll tear into shreds for the nonce.
5134,"i'll take the holy vow to be worthless,"
5135,to be drunken and go to the dogs.
5136,"the gardener xliii: no, my friends "
5137,"no, my friends, i shall never be an"
5138,"ascetic, whatever you may say."
5139,i shall never be and ascetic if she
5140,does not take the vow with me.
5141,it is my firm resolve that if i 
5142,cannot find a shady shelter and a 
5143,"companion for my penance, i shall"
5144,never turn ascetic.
5145,"no, my friends, i shall never leave"
5146,"my hearth and home, and retire into"
5147,"the forest solitude, if rings no merry"
5148,laughter in its echoing shade and if 
5149,the end of no saffron mantle flutters
5150,in the wind; if its silence is not
5151,deepened by soft whispers.
5152,i shall never be an ascetic.
5153,"the gardener xliv: reverend sir, forgive "
5154,"reverend sir, forgive this pair of"
5155,sinners. spring winds to-day are 
5156,"blowing in wild eddies, driving dust"
5157,"and dead leaves away, and with them "
5158,your lessons are all lost.
5159,"do not say, father, that life is a "
5160,for we have made truce with death
5161,"for once, and only for a few fragrant"
5162,hours we two have been made immortal.
5163,even if the king's army came and
5164,fiercely fell upon us we should sadly
5165,"shake our heads and say, brothers,"
5166,you are disturbing us. if you must
5167,"have this noisy game, go and clatter "
5168,your arms elsewhere. since only for
5169,a few fleeting moments we have been
5170,if friendly people came and flocked
5171,"around us, we should humbly bow to"
5172,"them and say, this extravagant good"
5173,fortune is an embarrassment to us.
5174,room is scarce in the infinite sky
5175,where we dwell. for in the spring-
5176,"time flowers come in crowds, and the "
5177,busy wings of bees jostle each other.
5178,"our little heaven, where dwell only "
5179,"we two immortals, is too absurdly"
5180,the gardener xlv: to the guests 
5181,to the guests that must go bid
5182,god's speed and brush away all traces
5183,of their steps.
5184,take to your bosom with a smile
5185,what is easy and simple and near.
5186,to-day is the festival of phantoms
5187,that know not when they die.
5188,let your laughter be but a meaning-
5189,less mirth like twinkles of light on
5190,let your life lightly dance on the
5191,edges of time like dew on the tip of
5192,strike in chords from your harp
5193,fitful momentary rhythms.
5194,the gardener xlvi: you left me 
5195,you left me and went on your way.
5196,i thought i should mourn for you
5197,and set your solitary image in my
5198,heart wrought in a golden song.
5199,"but ah, my evil fortune, time is "
5200,youth wanes year after year; the
5201,spring days are fugitive; the frail
5202,"flowers die for nothing, and the wise"
5203,man warns me that life is but a
5204,dewdrop on the lotus leaf.
5205,should i neglect all this to gaze after
5206,one who has turned her back on me?
5207,"that would be rude and foolish,"
5208,for time is short.
5209,"then, come, my rainy nights with"
5210,"pattering feet; smile, my golden "
5211,"autumn; come, careless april, scatter-"
5212,ing your kisses abroad.
5213,"you come, and you, and you also!"
5214,"my loves, you know we are mortals."
5215,is it wise to break one's heart for the 
5216,one who takes her heart away? for
5217,time is short.
5218,it is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
5219,and write in rhymes that you are all
5220,it is heroic to hug one's sorrow and 
5221,determine not to be consoled.
5222,but a fresh face peeps across my
5223,door and raise its eyes to my eyes.
5224,i cannot but wipe away my tears 
5225,and change the tune of my song.
5226,for time is short.
5227,the gardener xlviii: free me 
5228,free me from the bonds of your
5229,"sweetness, my love! nor more of this"
5230,wine of kisses.
5231,this mist of heavy incense stifles
5232,"open the doors, make room for the"
5233,"i am lost in you, wrapped in the"
5234,folds of your caresses.
5235,"free me from your spells, and give"
5236,me back the manhood to offer you my
5237,the gardener xvi: hands cling to eyes 
5238,hands cling to hands and eyes linger
5239,on eyes: thus begins the record of our
5240,it is the moonlit night of march;
5241,the sweet smell of henna is in the air;
5242,my flute lies on the earth neglected 
5243,and your garland of flowers is
5244,this love between you and me is
5245,simple as a song.
5246,your veil of the saffron colour
5247,makes my eyes drunk.
5248,the jasmine wreath that you wove
5249,me thrills to my heart like praise.
5250,it is a game of giving and with-
5251,"holding, revealing and screening again;"
5252,"some smiles and some little shyness,"
5253,and some sweet useless struggles.
5254,this love between you and me is
5255,simple as a song.
5256,no mystery beyond the present;
5257,no striving for the impossible; no
5258,shadow behind the charm; no groping
5259,in the depth of the dark.
5260,this love between you and me is
5261,simple as a song.
5262,we do not stray out of all words
5263,into the ever silent; we do not raise
5264,our hands to the void for things
5265,it is enough what we give and we
5266,we have not crushed the joy to 
5267,the utmost to wring from it the wine
5268,this love between you and me is
5269,simple as a song.
5270,the gardener xviii: when two sisters 
5271,when the two sisters go to fetch
5272,"water, they come to this spot and"
5273,they must be aware of somebody 
5274,who stands behind the trees when-
5275,ever they go to fetch water.
5276,the two sisters whisper to each 
5277,other when they pass this spot.
5278,they must have guessed the secret 
5279,of that somebody who stands behind
5280,the trees whenever they go to
5281,"their pitchers lurch suddenly, and"
5282,water spills when they reach this 
5283,they must have found out that
5284,somebody's heart is beating who 
5285,stands behind the trees whenever
5286,they go to fetch water.
5287,the two sisters glance at each other
5288,"when they come to this spot, and they "
5289,there is a laughter in their swift-
5290,"stepping feet, which makes confusion"
5291,in somebody's mind who stands behind
5292,the trees whenever they go to

5294,day after day he comes and goes
5295,"go, and give him a flower from my "
5296,"hair, my friend."
5297,"if he asks who was it that sent it, i"
5298,entreat you do not tell him my name--
5299,for he only comes and goes away.
5300,he sits on the dust under the tree.
5301,spread there a seat with flowers and
5302,"leaves, my friend."
5303,"his eyes are sad, and they bring"
5304,sadness to my heart.
5305,he does not speak what he has in
5306,mind; he only comes and goes away.
5307,the gardener xxi: why did he choose 
5308,why did he choose to come to my
5309,"door, the wandering youth, when the"
5310,as i come in and out i pass by him
5311,"every time, and my eyes are caught by "
5312,i know not if i should speak to him
5313,or keep silent. why did he choose to 
5314,come to my door?
5315,the cloudy nights in july are dark;
5316,the sky is soft blue in the autumn; the
5317,spring days are restless with the south
5318,he weaves his songs with fresh
5319,tunes every time.
5320,i turn from my work and my eyes
5321,fill with the mist. why did he choose 
5322,to come to my door?
5323,the gardener xxii: when she passed by me 
5324,when she passed by me with quick
5325,"steps, the end of her skirt touched"
5326,from the unknown island of a 
5327,heart came a sudden warm breath of
5328,a flutter of a flitting touch brushed
5329,"me and vanished in a moment, like a "
5330,torn flower petal blown in the breeze.
5331,it fell upon my heart like a sigh of
5332,her body and whisper of her heart.
5333,the gardener xxiv: do not keep to yourself 
5334,do not keep to yourself the secret of
5335,"your heart, my friend!"
5336,"say it to me, only to me, in secret."
5337,"you who smile so gently, softly"
5338,"whisper, my heart will hear it, not my"
5339,"the night is deep, the house is"
5340,"silent, the birds' nests are shrouded"

5378,"dark, i cannot understand them."""
5379,the gardener xxviii: your questioning eyes 
5380,your questioning eyes are sad. they
5381,seek to know my meaning as the moon
5382,would fathom the sea.
5383,i have bared my life before your
5384,"eyes from end to end, with nothing"
5385,hidden or held back. that is why you
5386,know me not.
5387,"if it were only a gem, i could break"
5388,it into a hundred pieces and string
5389,them into a chain to put on your neck.
5390,"if it were only a flower, round and"
5391,"small and sweet, i could pluck it from"
5392,its stem to set it in your hair.
5393,"but it is a heart, my beloved."

5404,"its pleasure and pain are boundless,"
5405,and endless its wants and wealth.
5406,"it is as near to you as your life, but"
5407,you can never wholly know it.

5409,"do not go, my love, without asking"

5422,"alas, i was not careful, and it struck"
5423,your ringing anklets and came to

5425,lay scattered at your feet.
5426,all my cargo of the stories of old

5429,"you must make this loss good to me,"
5430,if my claims to immortal fame after

5449,the hero

5451,strange and dangerous country.
5452,you are riding in a palanquin and i am trotting by you on a

5464,"that near the bank?"""
5465,"just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come"
5466,running towards us.
5467,you sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the
5468,gods in prayer.
5469,"the bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny"
5470,"i shout to you, ""don't be afraid, mother. i am here."""
5471,with long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their
5472,"heads, they come nearer and nearer."
5473,"i shout, ""have a care, you villains! one step more and you are"
5474,they give another terrible yell and rush forward.
5475,"you clutch my hand and say, ""dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep"
5476,"away from them."""
5477,"i say, ""mother, just you watch me."""
5478,"then i spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and"
5479,buckler clash against each other.
5480,"the fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you"
5481,a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.
5482,"many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces."
5483,"i know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your"
5484,boy must be dead by this time.
5485,"but i come to you all stained with blood, and say,""mother, the"
5486,"fight is over now."""
5487,"you come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you"
5488,"say to yourself,"
5489,"""i don't know what i should do if i hadn't my boy to escort"
5490,"a thousand useless things happen day after day, and why"
5491,couldn't such a thing come true by chance?
5492,it would be like a story in a book.
5493,"my brother would say, ""is it possible? i always thought he was"
5494,"our village people would all say in amazement, ""was it not"
5495,"lucky that the boy was with his mother?"""
5496,the journey 
5497,the morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; 
5498,and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; 
5499,and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds 
5500,while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. 
5501,we sang no glad songs nor played; 
5502,we went not to the village for barter; 
5503,we spoke not a word nor smiled; 
5504,we lingered not on the way. 
5505,we quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by. 
5506,the sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. 
5507,withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. 
5508,"the shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, "
5509,and i laid myself down by the water 
5510,and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. 
5511,my companions laughed at me in scorn; 
5512,they held their heads high and hurried on; 
5513,they never looked back nor rested; 
5514,they vanished in the distant blue haze. 
5515,"they crossed many meadows and hills, "
5516,"and passed through strange, far-away countries. "
5517,"all honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! "
5518,"mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, "
5519,but found no response in me. 
5520,i gave myself up for lost 
5521,in the depth of a glad humiliation 
5522,---in the shadow of a dim delight. 
5523,the repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom 
5524,slowly spread over my heart. 
5525,"i forgot for what i had traveled, "
5526,and i surrendered my mind without struggle 
5527,to the maze of shadows and songs. 
5528,"at last, when i woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, "
5529,"i saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. "
5530,"how i had feared that the path was long and wearisome, "
5531,and the struggle to reach thee was hard!
5532,the judge 
5533,"say of him what you please, but i know my child's failings."
5534,"i do not love him because he is good, but because he is my"
5535,how should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
5536,his merits against his faults?
5537,when i must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
5538,when i cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.
5539,"i alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may"
5540,chastise who loves
5541,the land of the exile
5542,"mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; i do not know what"
5543,the time is.
5544,"there is no fun in my play, so i have come to you. it is"
5545,"saturday, our holiday."
5546,"leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell"
5547,me where the desert of tepantar in the fairy tale is.
5548,the shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end.
5549,the fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.
5550,"when the clouds rumble and it thunders, i love to be afraid"
5551,in my heart and cling to you.
5552,"when the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves,"
5553,"and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, i like to"
5554,"sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about"
5555,the desert of tepantar in the fairy tale.
5556,"where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of"
5557,"what hills, in the kingdom of what king?"
5558,"there are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath"
5559,across it by which the villagers reach their village in the
5560,"evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can"
5561,bring her load to the market. with patches of yellow grass in the
5562,sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their
5563,"nest, lies the desert of tepantar."
5564,"i can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son"
5565,"of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in"
5566,search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace
5567,across that unknown water.
5568,"when the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and"
5569,"lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his"
5570,"unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and"
5571,"wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of tepantar in"
5572,the fairy tale?
5573,"see, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and"
5574,thee are no travellers yonder on the village road.
5575,"the shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men"
5576,have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their
5577,"huts, watching the scowling clouds."
5578,"mother, i have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me"
5579,to do my lessons now.
5580,"when i grow up and am bid like my father, i shall learn all"
5581,that must be learnt.
5582,"but just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of"
5583,tepantar in the fairy tale is.
5584,the last bargain 
5585,"""come and hire me,"" i cried, while in the morning i was walking on the stone-paved road. "
5586,"sword in hand, the king came in his chariot. "
5587,"he held my hand and said, ""i will hire you with my power."" "
5588,"but his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot. "
5589,in the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors. 
5590,i wandered along the crooked lane. 
5591,an old man came out with his bag of gold. 
5592,"he pondered and said, ""i will hire you with my money."" "
5593,"he weighed his coins one by one, but i turned away. "
5594,it was evening. the garden hedge was all aflower. 
5595,"the fair maid came out and said, ""i will hire you with a smile."" "
5596,"her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark. "
5597,"the sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly. "
5598,a child sat playing with shells. 
5599,"he raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""i hire you with nothing."" "
5600,from thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

5602,i am small because i am a little child. i shall be big when i am
5603,as old as my father is.

5605,"and your books."""

5609,"likes, for he is grown up."""

5612,"lost, my boy; let me carry you."""
5613,"i shall answer, ""can't you see, uncle, i am as big as father?"
5614,"i must go to the fair alone."""
5615,"uncle will say, ""yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is"

5619,"i shall tell her, ""mother, don't you know, i am as big as"
5620,"father, and i must give silver to my nurse."""

5623,"in the holiday time in october father will come home and,"
5624,"thinking that i am still a baby, will bring for me from the town"
5625,little shoes and small silken frocks.

5630,the lotus 
5631,"on the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, "
5632,and i knew it not. my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. 
5633,"only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and i started up from my "
5634,dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. 
5635,that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to 
5636,me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion. 
5637,"i knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this "
5638,perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.
5639,the rainy day 
5640,sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the

5642,the palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
5643,against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
5644,"silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river"
5645,is haunted by a deepening gloom.
5646,"our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence."
5647,"o child, wait here till i bring her into the stall."
5648,men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
5649,as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
5650,running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
5651,has run away from his mother to tease her.
5652,"listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford."
5653,"o child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry"
5654,the sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
5655,water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
5656,early from the ganges with their filled pitchers.
5657,the evening lamps must be made ready.
5658,"o child, do not go out!"
5659,"the road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is"
5660,slippery. the wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
5661,branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.
5662,the recall 
5663,"the night was dark when she went away, and the slept."
5664,"the night is dark now, and i call for her, ""come back, my"
5665,"darling; the world is asleep; and no one would know, if you came"
5666,"for a moment while stars are gazing at stars."""
5667,she went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was

5670,"and if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it."""

5672,"i listen to their chatter and call, ""come back, my darling,"

5688,i shall take my friend ashu with me. we shall sail merrily

5700,"it comes? yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where,"
5701,in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with
5702,"glow-worms, there hang two shy buds of enchantment. from there it"
5703,comes to kiss baby's eyes.
5704,the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps-does
5705,"anybody know where it was born? yes, there is a rumour that a young"
5706,pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn
5707,"cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew"
5708,washed morning-the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he

5710,"anybody know where it was hidden so long? yes, when the mother was"
5711,a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent
5712,"mystery of love-the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on"
5713,the unheeded pageant 
5714,"ah, who was it coloured that little frock, my child, and covered"
5715,your sweet limbs with that little red tunic?
5716,"you have come out in the morning to play in the courtyard,"
5717,tottering and tumbling as you run.
5718,"but who was it coloured that little frock, my child?"
5719,"what is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud?"
5720,mother smiles at you standing on the threshold.
5721,"she claps her hands and her bracelets jingle, and you dance"
5722,with your bamboo stick in your hand like a tiny little shepherd.
5723,"but what is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud?"
5724,"o beggar, what do you bed for, clinging to your mother's neck"
5725,with both your hands?
5726,"o greedy heart, shall i pluck the world like a fruit from the"
5727,sky to place it on your little rosy palm?
5728,"o beggar, what are you begging for?"
5729,the wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
5730,the sun smiles and watches your toilet.
5731,"the sky watches over you when you sleep in your mother's arms,"
5732,and the morning comes tiptoe to your bed and kisses your eyes.
5733,the wind carried away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
5734,"the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying"
5735,through the twilight sky.
5736,the world-mother keeps her seat by you in your mother's heart.
5737,he who plays his music to the stars is standing at your window
5738,with his flute.
5739,"and the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying"
5740,through the twilight sky.
5741,the wicked postman 
5742,"why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me,"
5743,"the rain is coming in through the open window, making you all"
5744,"wet, and you don't mind it."
5745,do you hear the gong striking four? it is time for my brother
5746,to come home from school.
5747,what has happened to you that you look so strange?
5748,haven't you got a letter from father today?
5749,i saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost
5750,everybody in the town.
5751,only father's letters he keeps to read himself. i am sure the
5752,postman is a wicked man.
5753,"but don't be unhappy about that, mother dear."
5754,tomorrow is market day in the next village. you ask your maid
5755,to buy some pens and papers.
5756,i myself will write all father's letters; you will not find
5757,a single mistake.
5758,i shall write from a right up to k.
5759,"but, mother, why do you smile?"
5760,you don't believe that i can write as nicely as father does!
5761,"but i shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters"
5762,when i finish my writing do you think i shall be so foolish
5763,as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?
5764,"i shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by"
5765,letter help you to read my writing.
5766,i know the postman does not like to give you the really nice
5767,i was not aware of the moment 
5768,when i first crossed the threshold of this life. 
5769,what was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery 
5770,like a bud in the forest at midnight! 
5771,when in the morning i looked upon the light 
5772,"i felt in a moment that i was no stranger in this world, "
5773,that the inscrutable without name and form 
5774,had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. 
5775,"even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. "
5776,"and because i love this life, "
5777,i know i shall love death as well. 
5778,the child cries out 
5779,"when from the right breast the mother takes it away, "
5780,in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.
5781,twelve o'clock by rabindranath tagore
5782,"mother, i do want to leave off my lessons now. i have been at my"
5783,book all the morning.
5784,you say it is only twelve o'clock. suppose it isn't any later;
5785,can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve
5786,i can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of
5787,"that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for"
5788,her supper by the side of the pond.
5789,i can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing
5790,"darker under the madar tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny"
5791,"if twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night"
5792,come when it is twelve o'clock?
5793,untimely leave 
5794,"no more noisy, loud words from me---such is my master's will. "
5795,henceforth i deal in whispers. 
5796,the speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song. 
5797,men hasten to the king's market. all the buyers and sellers are there. 
5798,"but i have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work. "
5799,"let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; "
5800,and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum. 
5801,"full many an hour have i spent in the strife of the good and the evil, "
5802,but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; 
5803,and i know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!
5804,when the gong sounds ten in the morning and i walk to school by our
5805,"every day i meet the hawker crying, ""bangles, crystal"
5806,"there is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must"
5807,"take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home."
5808,"i wish i were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying,"
5809,"""bangles, crystal bangles!"""
5810,"when at four in the afternoon i come back from the school, "
5811,i can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
5812,"he does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes"
5813,"with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or"
5814,i wish i were a gardener digging away at the garden with
5815,nobody to stop me from digging.
5816,just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to
5817,i can see through my open window the watchman walking up and
5818,"the lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like"
5819,a giant with one red eye in its head.
5820,the watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at
5821,"his side, and never once goes to bed in his life."
5822,"i wish i were a watchman walking the streets all night,"
5823,chasing the shadows with my lantern.
5824,when and why 
5825,"when i bring you coloured toys, my child, i understand why there"
5826,"is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are"
5827,"painted in tints-when i give coloured toys to you, my child."
5828,"when i sing to make you dance, i truly know why there is music"
5829,"in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart"
5830,of the listening earth-when i sing to make you dance.
5831,"when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands, i know why"
5832,"there is honey in the cup of the flower, and why fruits are"
5833,secretly filled with sweet juice-when i bring sweet things to your
5834,"when i kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, i surely"
5835,"understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and"
5836,what delight the summer breeze brings to my body-when i kiss you
5837,to make you smile.
5838,when day is done 
5839,"if the day is done, "
5840,"if birds sing no more, "
5841,"if the wind has flagged tired, "
5842,"then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, "
5843,even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep 
5844,and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.
5845,two of us once met
5846,where the streams of life and death had stopped
5847,where time stood still.
5848,today it is so far and away
5849,now i am sailing alone
5850,my boat is rocking in the storm
5851,i now remember again
5852,how once we met
5853,at the end of the world
5854,where had descended the heaven.
5855,we sat there side by side
5856,that day i realized
5857,what sways the blades of grass
5858,throughout the world
5859,in what delight everything shivers;
5860,in the dark how shine stars;
5861,in what great urge
5862,the breaths of life rush
5863,that day i realized
5864,when we woke up and looked at each other’s face.
5865,taking your hand in my hand
5866,i kept looking at the sky
5867,we had no words
5868,and didn’t know how our time passed
5869,that day i had realized in my heart of hearts
5870,where end the meanings of our words
5871,how music rises from the core of the universe
5872,how the pining woods blossom into flowers
5873,these we realized when both of us wept
5874,in endless pleasure.
5875,then we came to know in what fire
5876,silently burn the winds of spring
5877,why the morning sun
5878,yearns to get lost in everything
5879,why day and night the river runs
5880,to meet the sea
5881,why the lightning is hurt by its own light
5882,what game the night plays with dawn
5883,all these we realized
5884,when with each other we played

5887,"i seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…"
5888,"in life after life, in age after age, forever."
5889,"my spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,"
5890,"that you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,"
5891,"in life after life, in age after age, forever."
5892,"whenever i hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,"
5893,its ancient tale of being apart or together.
5894,"as i stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,"
5895,clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
5896,you become an image of what is remembered forever.
5897,you and i have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
5898,"at the heart of time, love of one for another."
5899,"we have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same"
5900,"shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-"
5901,old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.
5902,"today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you"
5903,the love of all man’s days both past and forever:
5904,"universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life."
5905,the memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
5906,and the songs of every poet past and forever.

5923,with my music

5928,freedom from fear is the freedom
5929,i claim for you my motherland!
5930,"freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,"
5931,"breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning"
5932,call of the future;
5933,freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
5934,"you fasten yourself in night's stillness,"
5935,mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
5936,freedom from the anarchy of destiny
5937,"whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,"
5938,and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
5939,"freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,"
5940,"where movements are started through brainless wires,"
5941,"repeated through mindless habits,"
5942,where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
5943,"master of show,"
5944,to be stirred into a mimicry of life.
5945,"every morning this dog, very attached to me,"
5946,quietly keeps sitting near my seat
5947,till touching its head
5948,i recognize its company.
5949,this recognition gives it so much joy
5950,pure delight ripples through its entire body.
5951,among all dumb creatures
5952,it is the only living being
5953,that has seen the whole man
5954,beyond what is good or bad in him
5955,it has seen
5956,for his love it can sacrifice its life
5957,it can love him too for the sake of love alone
5958,for it is he who shows the way
5959,to the vast world pulsating with life.
5960,when i see its deep devotion
5961,the offer of its whole being
5962,i fail to understand
5963,by its sheer instinct
5964,what truth it has discovered in man.
5965,by its silent anxious piteous looks
5966,it cannot communicate what it understands
5967,but it has succeeded in conveying to me
5968,among the whole creation
5969,what is the true status of man.
5970,one day in spring....
5971,"one day in spring, a woman came"
5972,"in my lonely woods,"
5973,in the lovely form of the beloved.
5974,"came, to give to my songs, melodies,"
5975,"to give to my dreams, sweetness."
5976,suddenly a wild wave
5977,broke over my heart's shores
5978,and drowned all language.
5979,"to my lips no name came,"
5980,"she stood beneath the tree, turned,"
5981,"glanced at my face, made sad with pain,"
5982,"and with quick steps, came and sat by me."
5983,"taking my hands in hers, she said:"
5984,"'you do not know me, nor i you—"
5985,i wonder how this could be?'
5986,"'we two shall build, a bridge for ever"
5987,"between two beings, each to the other unknown,"
5988,this eager wonder is at the heart of things.'
5989,the cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;
5990,the thread with which she binds me binds her too.
5991,"her have i sought everywhere,"
5992,"her have i worshipped within me,"
5993,hidden in that worship she has sought me too.
5994,"crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart."
5995,"she forgot to return, having lost her own."
5996,"her own charms play traitor to her,"
5997,"she spreads her net, knowing not"
5998,whether she will catch or be caught.
5999,in the village they call her the dark girl
6000,but to me she is the flower krishnakali
6001,on a cloudy day in a field
6002,i saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
6003,"she had no covering on her head,"
6004,her loose hair had fallen on her back.
6005,"dark? however dark she be,"
6006,i have seen her dark gazelleeyes.
6007,"two black cows were lowing,"
6008,as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.
6009,"so with anxious, hurried steps,"
6010,the dark girl came from her hut.
6011,"raising her eyebrows toward the sky,"
6012,she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.
6013,"dark? however dark she be,"
6014,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
6015,a gust of the east wind
6016,rippled the rice plants.
6017,"i was standing by a ridge,"
6018,alone in the field.
6019,whether or not she looked at me
6020,is known only to us two.
6021,"dark? however dark she be,"
6022,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
6023,this how the kohldark cloud
6024,rises in the northeast in jaistha;
6025,the soft dark shadow
6026,descends on the tamal grove in asharh;
6027,and sudden delight floods the heart
6028,in the night of sravan.
6029,"dark? however dark she be,"
6030,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
6031,"to me she is the flower krishnakali,"
6032,whatever she may be called by others.
6033,in a field in maynapara village
6034,i saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
6035,"she did not cover her head,"
6036,not having the time to feel embarrassed.
6037,"dark? however dark she be,"
6038,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
6039,the song i came to sing 
6040,remains unsung to this day. 
6041,i have spent my days in stringing 
6042,and in unstringing my instrument. 
6043,"the time has not come true, "
6044,the words have not been rightly set; 
6045,only there is the agony 
6046,of wishing in my heart….. 
6047,"i have not seen his face, "
6048,nor have i listened to his voice; 
6049,only i have heard his gentle footsteps 
6050,from the road before my house….. 
6051,but the lamp has not been lit 
6052,and i cannot ask him into my house; 
6053,i live in the hope of meeting with him; 
6054,but this meeting is not yet.
6055,"my fancies are fireflies, — "
6056,specks of living light
6057,twinkling in the dark.
6058,"he voice of wayside pansies,"
6059,"that do not attract the careless glance,"
6060,murmurs in these desultory lines.
6061,in the drowsy dark caves of the mind
6062,dreams build their nest with fragments
6063,dropped from day's caravan.
6064,spring scatters the petals of flowers
6065,"that are not for the fruits of the future,"
6066,but for the moment's whim.
6067,joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber
6068,"rushes into numberless leaves,"
6069,and dances in the air for a day.
6070,my words that are slight
6071,my lightly dance upon time's waves
6072,when my works havy with import have gone down.
6073,mind's underground moths
6074,grow filmy wings
6075,and take a farewell flight
6076,in the sunset sky.
6077,"the butterfly counts not months but moments,"
6078,and has time enough.
6079,"my thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,"
6080,carrying a single laughter.
6081,the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
6082,which yet it never can grasp.
6083,"let my love, like sunlight, surround you"
6084,and yet give you illumined freedom.
6085,days are coloured vbubbles
6086,that float upon the surface of fathomless night.
6087,"my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,"
6088,and therefore you may remember them.
6089,leave out my name from the gift
6090,"if it be a burden,"
6091,but keep my song.
6092,"april, like a child,"
6093,"writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers,"
6094,wipes them away and forgets.
6095,"memory, the priestess,"
6096,kills the present
6097,and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.
6098,from the solemn gloom of the temple
6099,"children run out to sit in the dust,"
6100,god watches them play
6101,and forgets the priest.
6102,my mind starts up at some flash
6103,on the flow of its thoughts
6104,like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
6105,that is never repeated.
6106,"in the mountain, stillness surges up"
6107,to explore its own height;
6108,"in the lake, movement stands still"
6109,to contemplate its own depth.
6110,the departing night's one kiss
6111,on the closed eyes of morning
6112,glows in the star of dawn.
6113,"maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit"
6114,"which is yet to mature,"
6115,tense with an unyielding secret.
6116,sorrow that has lost its memory
6117,is like the dumb dark hours
6118,that have no bird songs
6119,but only the cricket's chirp.
6120,bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand
6121,with a grip that kills it.
6122,wishing to hearten a timid lamp
6123,great night lights all her stars.
6124,"though he holds in his arms the earth-bride,"
6125,the sky is ever immensely away.
6126,"god seeks comrades and claims love,"
6127,the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.
6128,the soil in return for her service
6129,"keeps the tree tied to her,"
6130,the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.
6131,does not boast of its length of years
6132,but of the scintillating point of its moment.
6133,"the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,"
6134,unobscured by the dust of history.
6135,alight laughter in the steps of creation
6136,carries it swiftly across time.
6137,"one who was distant came near to me in the morning,"
6138,and still nearer when taken away by night.
6139,white and pink oleanders meet
6140,and make merry in different dialects.
6141,"when peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm."
6142,"the lake lies low by the hill,"
6143,a tearful entreaty of love
6144,at the foot of the inflexible.
6145,there smiles the divine child
6146,among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
6147,and ephemeral lights and shadows.
6148,"the breeze whispers to the lotus,"
6149,"""what is thy secret?"""
6150,"""it is myself,"" says the lotus,"
6151,"""steal it and i disappear!"""
6152,the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
6153,join hands in the dance of swaying branches.
6154,the jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.
6155,the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
6156,and yet to keep it for himself.
6157,"gods, tired of their paradise, envy man."
6158,"clouds are hills in vapour,"
6159,"hills are clouds in stone, —"
6160,a phantasy in time's dream.
6161,"while god waits for his temple to be built of love,"
6162,men bring stones.
6163,i touch god in my song
6164,as the hill touches the far-away sea
6165,with its waterfall.
6166,light finds her treasure of colours
6167,through the antagonism of clouds.
6168,my heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears
6169,like a wet tree glistening in the sun 
6170,after the rain is over.
6171,"i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,"
6172,but have failed to remember the grass
6173,that has ever kept it green.
6174,"the one without second is emptiness,"
6175,the other one makes it true.
6176,life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
6177,that can modulate their isolation
6178,into a harmony with the whole.
6179,they expect thanks for the banished nest
6180,because their cage is shapely and secure.
6181,in love i pay my endless debt to thee
6182,for what thou art.
6183,"the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,"
6184,"and the sun says, they are good."
6185,"your calumny against the great is impious,"
6186,it hurts yourself;
6187,"against the small it is mean,"
6188,for it hurts the victim.
6189,the first flower that blossomed on this earth
6190,was an invitation to the unborn song.
6191,"dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades,"
6192,"and then the simple light-fruit,"
6193,the sun appears.
6194,the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
6195,throttles the voice that would cry.
6196,the wind tries to take the flame by storm 
6197,only to blow it out.
6198,"life's play is swift,"
6199,life's playthings fall behind one by one
6200,and are forgotten.
6201,"my flower, seek not thy paradise"
6202,in a fool's buttonhole.
6203,"thou hast risen late, my crescent moon,"
6204,but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.
6205,darkness is the veiled bride
6206,silently waiting for the errant light
6207,to return to her bosom.
6208,trees are the earth's endless effort to
6209,speak to the listening heaven.
6210,the burden of self is lightened
6211,when i laugh at myself.
6212,the weak can be terrible 
6213,because they try furiously to appear strong.
6214,"the wind of heaven blows,"
6215,"the anchor desperately clutches the mud,"
6216,and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.
6217,"the spirit of death is one,"
6218,"the spirit of life is many,"
6219,whe god is dead religion becomes one.
6220,"the blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,"
6221,"the wind between them sighs, ""alas."""
6222,"day's pain muffled by its own glare,"
6223,burns among stars in the night.
6224,the stars crowd round the virgin night
6225,in silent awe at her loneliness
6226,that can never be touched.
6227,the cloud gives all its gold
6228,to the departing sun
6229,and greets the rising moon
6230,with only a pale smile.
6231,"he who does good comes to the temple gate,"
6232,he who loves reaches the shrine.
6233,"flower, have pity for the worm,"
6234,"it is not a bee,"
6235,its love is a blunder and a burden.
6236,with the ruins of terror's triumph
6237,children build their doll's house.
6238,the lamp waits through the long day of neglect
6239,for the flame's kiss in the night.
6240,feathers in the dust lying lazily content
6241,have forgotten their sky.
6242,the flowers which is single
6243,need not envy the thorns
6244,that are numerous.
6245,the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
6246,of its well-wisher.
6247,we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price
6248,for our right to live.
6249,"your careless gifts of a moment,"
6250,"like the meteors of an autumn night,"
6251,catch fire in the depth of my being.
6252,the faith waiting in the heart of a seed
6253,promises a miracle of life
6254,which it cannot prove at once.
6255,"spring hesitates at winter's door,"
6256,but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him
6257,before her time and meets her doom.
6258,the world is the ever-changing foam
6259,thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.
6260,the two separated shores mingle their voices
6261,in a song of unfathomed tears.
6262,"as a river in the sea,"
6263,work finds its fulfilment
6264,in the depth of leisure.
6265,"i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,"
6266,"but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness."
6267,"thy shy little pomegranate bud,"
6268,"blushing to-day behind her veil,"
6269,will burst into a passionate flower
6270,to-morrow when i am away.
6271,"the clumsiness of power spoils the key,"
6272,and uses the pickaxe.
6273,birth is from the mystery of night
6274,into the grerater mystery of day.
6275,these paper boats of mine are meant to dance
6276,"on the ripples of hours,"
6277,and not to reach any destination.
6278,migratory songs wing from my heart
6279,and seek their nests in your voice of love.
6280,"the sea of danger, doubt and denial"
6281,around man's little island of certainty
6282,challenges him to dare the unknown.
6283,"love punishes when it forgives,"
6284,and injured beauty by its awful silence.
6285,you live alone and unrecompensed
6286,because they are afraid of your great worth.
6287,the same sun is newly born in new lands
6288,in a ring of endless dawns.
6289,"god is world is ever renewed by death,"
6290,a titan's ever crushed by its own existence.
6291,the glow-worm while exploring the dust
6292,never knows that stars are in the sky.
6293,"the tree is of to-day, the flower is old,"
6294,it brings with it the message
6295,of the immemorial seed.
6296,each rose that comes brings me greetings
6297,from the rose of an eternal spring.
6298,"god honours me when i work,"
6299,he loves me when i sing.
6300,my love of to-day finds no home
6301,in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.
6302,the fire of pain tracse for my soul
6303,a luminous path across her sorrow.
6304,the grass survives the hill
6305,through its resurrections from countless deaths.
6306,thou hast vanished from my reach
6307,"leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,"
6308,an invisible image in the wind moving
6309,among the shadows.
6310,in pity for the desolate branch
6311,spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.
6312,the shy shadow in the farden
6313,"loves the sun in silence,"
6314,"flowers guess the secret, and mile,"
6315,while the leaves whisper.
6316,"i leave no trace of wings in the air,"
6317,but i am glad i have had my flight.
6318,"the fireflies, twinkling among leaves,"
6319,make the stars wonder.
6320,the mountain remains unmoved
6321,at its seeming defeat by the mist.
6322,"while the rose said to the sun,"
6323,"""i shall ever remember thee,"""
6324,her petals fell to the dust.
6325,hills are the earth's gesture of despair
6326,for the unreachable.
6327,"though the thorn in thy flower pricked me,"
6328,i am grateful.
6329,the world knows that the few
6330,are more than the many.

6338,the dew-drop knows the sun
6339,only within its own tiny orb.
6340,"forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,"
6341,"swarming in the air, hum round my heart"
6342,and seek my voice.
6343,the desert is imprisoned in the wall
6344,of its unbounded barrenness.
6345,in the thrill of little leaves
6346,"i see the air's invisible dance,"
6347,and in their glimmering
6348,the secret heart-beats of the sky.
6349,"you are like a flowering tree,"
6350,amazed when i praise you for your gifts.
6351,the earth's sacrifical fire
6352,"flames up in her trees,"
6353,scattering sparks in flowers.
6354,"foretsts, the clouds of earth,"
6355,"hold up to the sky their silence,"
6356,and clouds from above come down
6357,in resonant showers.
6358,"the world speaks to me in pictures,"
6359,my soul answers in music.
6360,the sky tells its beads all night
6361,on the countless stars
6362,in memory of the sun.

6366,loe offers her surrender in flowers.
6367,the obsequious brush curtails truth
6368,in diference to the canvas which is narrow.
6369,the hill in its longing for the far-away sky
6370,wishes to be like the cloud
6371,with its endless urge of seeking.
6372,to justify their own spilling of ink
6373,they spell the day as night.
6374,profit smiles on goodness
6375,when the good is profitable.
6376,in its swelling pride
6377,"the bubble doubts the turth of the sea,"
6378,and laughs and bursts into emptiness.
6379,"love is an endless mystery,"
6380,for it has nothing else to explain its.
6381,"my clouds, sorrowing in the dark,"
6382,forget that they themselves
6383,have hidden the sun.
6384,man discovers his own wealth
6385,when god comes to ask gifts of him.
6386,you leave your memory as a flame
6387,to my lonely lamp of separation.

6389,"but thou must have all my garden,—"
6390,it is thine.
6391,the picture—a memory of light
6392,treasured by the shadow.
6393,"it is easy to make faces at the sun,"
6394,he is exposed by his own light in all
6395,"history slowly smothers its truth,"
6396,but hastily struggles to revive it
6397,in the terrible penance of pain.
6398,"my work is rewarded in daily wages,"
6399,i wait for my final value in love.
6400,"beauty knows to say, ""enough,"""
6401,barbarism clamours for still more.
6402,"god loves to see in me, not his servant,"
6403,but himself who serves all.
6404,"the darkness of night is in harmony with day,"
6405,the morning of mist is discordant.
6406,"in the bounteous time of roses love is wine,—"
6407,it is food in the famished hour
6408,when their petals are shed.
6409,an unknown flower in a strange land
6410,speaks to the poet:
6411,"""are we not of the same soil, my lover?"""
6412,i am able to love my god
6413,because he gives me freedom to deny him.
6414,my untuned strings beg for music
6415,in their anguished cry of shame.
6416,the worm thinks it strange and foolish
6417,that man does not eat his books.
6418,the clouded sky to-day bears the visior
6419,of the shadow of a divine sadness
6420,on the forehead of brooding eternity.
6421,"the shade of my tree is for passers-by,"
6422,its fruit for the one for whom i wait.
6423,flushed with the glow of sunset
6424,earth seems like a ripe fruit
6425,ready to be harvested by night.
6426,light accepts darkness for his spouse
6427,for the sake of creation.
6428,"the reed waits for his master's breath,"
6429,the master goes seeking for his reed.
6430,"to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,"
6431,its writing unmeaning.
6432,the sea smites his own barren breast
6433,because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.
6434,the greed for fruit misses the flower.
6435,god in his temple of stars
6436,waits for man to bring him his lamp.
6437,the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.
6438,"released from bonds, the shameless flame"
6439,dies in barren ashes.
6440,"the sky sets no snare to capture the moon,"
6441,it is her own freedom which binds her.
6442,the light that fills the sky
6443,seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.
6444,"wealth is the burden of bigness,"
6445,welfare the fulness of being.
6446,the razor-blade is proud of its keenness
6447,when it sneers at the sun.
6448,"the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,"
6449,not the bee busily storing honey.
6450,"child, thou bringest to my heart"
6451,"the babble of the wind and the water,"
6452,"the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,"
6453,the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.
6454,the rainbow among the clouds may be great
6455,but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.
6456,"the mist weaves her net round the morning,"
6457,"captivates him, and makes him blind."
6458,"the morning star whispers to dawn,"
6459,"""tell me that you are only for me."""
6460,"""yes,"" she answers,"
6461,"""and also only for that nameless flower."""
6462,the sky remains infinitely vacant
6463,for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.
6464,perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
6465,at being told that it is a fragment
6466,let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
6467,and thus win peace for herself.
6468,"beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,"
6469,in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.
6470,your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings
6471,and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.
6472,leaves are silences
6473,around flowers which are their words.
6474,the tree bears its thousand years
6475,as one large majestic moment.
6476,"my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,"
6477,but for the wayside shrines
6478,that surprise me at every bend.
6479,"hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,"
6480,is simple and inexplicable.
6481,death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated
6482,for it swells his store with more than he can claim.
6483,the sigh of the shore follows in vain
6484,the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.
6485,"truth loves its limits,"
6486,for there it meets the beautiful.
6487,between the shores of me and thee
6488,"there is the loud ocean, my own surging self,"
6489,which i long to cross.
6490,the right to possess boasts foolishly
6491,of its right to enjoy.
6492,the rose is a great deal more
6493,than a blushing apology for the thorn.
6494,day offers to the silence of stars
6495,his golden lute to be tuned
6496,for the endless life.
6497,"the wise know how to teach,"
6498,the fool how to smite.
6499,the centre is still and silent in the heart
6500,of an enternal dance of circles.
6501,the judge thinks that he is just when he compares
6502,the oil of another's lamp
6503,with the light of his own.
6504,the captive flower in the king's wreath
6505,smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.
6506,"its store of snow is the hill's own burden,"
6507,its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.
6508,listen to the prayer of the forest
6509,for its freedom in flowers.
6510,let your love see me
6511,even through the barrier of nearness.
6512,the spirit of work in creation is there
6513,to carry and help the spirit of play.
6514,"to carry the burden of the insturment,"
6515,"count the cost of its material,"
6516,"and never to know that it is for music,"
6517,is the tragedy of deaf life.
6518,faith is the bird that feels the light
6519,and sings when the dawn is still dark.
6520,"i bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,"
6521,to be cleansed with thy cool darkness
6522,for a new morning's festival.
6523,"the mountain fir, in its rustling,"
6524,modulates the memory of its fights with the storm
6525,into a hymn of peace.
6526,god honoured me with his fight
6527,"when i was rebellious,"
6528,he ignored me when i was languid.
6529,the sectarina thinks
6530,that he has the sea
6531,ladled into his private pond.
6532,in the shady depth of life
6533,are the lonely nests of memories
6534,that shrink from words.
6535,let my love find its strength
6536,"in the service of day,"
6537,its peace in the union of night.
6538,life sends up in blades of grass
6539,its silent hymn of praise
6540,to the unnamed light.
6541,the stars of night are to me
6542,the memorials of my day's faded flowers.
6543,"open thy door to that which must go,"
6544,for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.
6545,"true end is not in the reaching of the limit,"
6546,but in a completion which is limitless.
6547,the shore whispers to the sea:
6548,"""write to me what thy waves struggle to say."""
6549,the sea writes in foam again and again
6550,and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.
6551,let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings
6552,and make the music thine and mine.
6553,"the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,"
6554,"matured in joy and sorrow,"
6555,will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil
6556,for some further course of creation.
6557,"form is in matter, rhythm in force,"
6558,meaning in the person.
6559,"there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,"
6560,i seek thy company so that i may sing.
6561,"as the tree its leaves, i shed my words on the earth,"
6562,let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.
6563,"my faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,"
6564,"help thee, master, in thy creation."
6565,all the delights that i have felt
6566,in life's fruits and flowers
6567,"let me offer to thee at the end of the feast,"
6568,in a perfect union of love.
6569,some have thought deeply and explored the
6570,"meaning of thy truth,"
6571,and they are great;
6572,"i have listened to catch the music of thy play,"
6573,and i am glad.
6574,the tree is a winged spirit
6575,"released from the bondage of seed,"
6576,pursuing its adventure of life
6577,across the unknown.
6578,"the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,"
6579,the grass its service to the earth.
6580,the sun's kiss mellows into abandonment
6581,the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.
6582,"the flame met the earthen lamp in me,"
6583,and what a great marvel of light!
6584,mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth
6585,and therefore delude us.
6586,the cloud laughed at the rainbow
6587,saying that is was an upstart
6588,gaudy in its emptiness.
6589,"the rainbow calmly answered,"
6590,"""i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself."""
6591,let me not grope in vain in the dark
6592,but keep my mind still in the faith
6593,that the day will break
6594,and truth will appear
6595,in its simplicity.
6596,through the silent night
6597,i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning
6598,knock at my heart.
6599,my new love comes
6600,bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.
6601,the earth gazes at the moon and wonders
6602,that she sould have all her music in her smile.
6603,day with its glare of curiosity
6604,puts the stars to flight.
6605,"my mind has itstrue union with thee, o sky,"
6606,"at the window which is mine own,"
6607,and not in the open
6608,where thou hast thy sole kingdom.
6609,man claims god's flowers as his own
6610,when he weaves them in a garland.
6611,"the buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,"
6612,is ashamed that is has lost all its song.
6613,"like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,"
6614,the sun's rays robed in dark
6615,hide themselves under the ground.
6616,"like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,"
6617,they change their veil at the spring's call
6618,"and come out in the carnival of colours,"
6619,in flowers and leaves.
6620,my life's empty flute
6621,waits for its final music
6622,like the primal darkness
6623,before the stars came out.
6624,emancipation from the bondage of the soil
6625,is no freedom for the tree.
6626,the tapestry of life's story is woven
6627,with the threads of life's ties
6628,ever joining and breaking.
6629,those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words
6630,perch upon my song and dance.
6631,my soul to-night loses itself
6632,in the silent heart of a tree
6633,standing alone among the whispers of immensity.
6634,pearl shells cast up by the sea
6635,"on death's barren beach,—"
6636,a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.
6637,"the sunlight opens for me the word's gate,"
6638,love's light its terasure.
6639,"my life like the reed with ist stops,"
6640,has its play od colours
6641,through the gaps in its hopes and gains.
6642,let not my thanks to thee
6643,rob my silence of its fuller homage.
6644,life's aspirations come
6645,in the guise of children.
6646,the faded flower sighs
6647,that the spring has vanished for ever.
6648,in my life's garden
6649,my wealth has been of the shadows and lights
6650,that are never gathered and stored.
6651,the fruit that i have gained for ever
6652,is thet which thou hast accepted.
6653,the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
6654,in the heaven.
6655,"light is young, the ancient light;"
6656,"shadows are of the moment, they are born old."
6657,i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end
6658,will brong me across to the other shore
6659,from where i shall see.
6660,the butterfly flitting from flower to flower
6661,"ever remains mine,"
6662,i lose the one that is netted by me.
6663,"your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,"
6664,and my drowsy wings dream
6665,of a voyage to the light
6666,above the clouds.
6667,i miss the meaning of my own part
6668,in the play of life
6669,because i know not of the parts
6670,that others play.
6671,the flower sheds all its petals
6672,and finds the fruit.
6673,i leave my songs behind me 
6674,to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles
6675,and the joy of the wind from the south.
6676,dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil
6677,take part in the life of the forest.
6678,the mind ever seeks its words
6679,from its sounds and silence
6680,as the sky from its darkness and light.
6681,the unseen dark plays on his flute
6682,and the rhythm of light
6683,"eddies into stars and suns,"
6684,into thoughts and reams.
6685,my songs are to sing
6686,that i have loved thy singing.
6687,when the voice of the silent touches my words
6688,i know him and therefore i know myself.
6689,my last salutations are to them
6690,who knew me imperfect and loved me.
6691,"love's gift cannot be given,"
6692,it waits to be accepted.
6693,"when death comes and whispers to me,"
6694,"""thy days are ended,"""
6695,"let me say to him, ""i have lived in love"
6696,"and not in mere time."""
6697,"he will ask, ""will thy songs remain?"""
6698,"i shall say, ""i know not, but this i know"
6699,"that often when i sang i found my eternity."""
6700,"""let me light my lamp,"""
6701,"say the star,"
6702,'and never debate
6703,"if it will help to remove the darkness."""
6704,before the end of my journey
6705,may i reach within myself
6706,"the one which is the all,"
6707,leaving the outer shell
6708,to float away with the drifting multitude
6709,upon the current of chance and change.
6710,on the nature of love
6711,the night is black and the forest has no end;
6712,a million people thread it in a million ways.
6713,"we have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where"
6714,or with whom - of that we are unaware.
6715,but we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss
6716,"will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips."
6717,"scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs"
6718,"brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks."
6719,then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:
6720,whomever i see that instant i fall in love with.
6721,i call that person and cry: `this life is blest!
6722,for your sake such miles have i traversed!'
6723,all those others who came close and moved off
6724,in the darkness - i don't know if they exist or not.
6725,lips' language to lips' ears.
6726,"two drinking each other's heart, it seems."
6727,"two roving loves who have left home,"
6728,pilgrims to the confluence of lips.
6729,two waves rise by the law of love
6730,to break and die on two sets of lips.
6731,two wild desires craving each other
6732,meet at last at the body's limits.
6733,"love's writing a song in dainty letters,"
6734,layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.
6735,plucking flowers from two sets of lips
6736,perhaps to thread them into a chain later.
6737,this sweet union of lips
6738,is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.
6739,the sun of the first day
6740,the sun of the first day
6741,put the question
6742,to the new manifestation of life-
6743,who are you?
6744,there was no answer.
6745,years passed by.
6746,the last sun of the last day
6747,uttered the question 
6748,on the shore of the western sea
6749,in the hush of evening-
6750,who are you?
6751,no answer came again.
6752,lord of my life
6753,"thou who art the innermost spirit of my being,"
6754,"art thou pleased, lord of my life?"
6755,for i give to thee my cup filled with all
6756,the pain and delight that the crushed
6757,"grapes of my heart had surrendered,"
6758,"i wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,"
6759,and with the molten gold of my desires
6760,i fashioned playthings for thy passing hours.
6761,"i know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,"
6762,lord of my life.
6763,"didst thou store my days and nights,"
6764,"my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,"
6765,"and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,"
6766,and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?
6767,"i see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,"
6768,"lord of my life,"
6769,i wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven.
6770,for many were my days without service
6771,and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers
6772,that faded in the shade not offered to thee.
6773,often the tied strings of my lute slackened
6774,at the strains of thy tunes.
6775,and often at the ruin of wasted hours
6776,my desolate evenings were filled with tears.
6777,"but have my days come to their end at last,"
6778,"lord of my life, while my arms round thee"
6779,"grow limp, my kisses losing their truth?"
6780,then break up the meeting of this languid day!
6781,renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;
6782,and let the wedding come once again in
6783,a new ceremony of life.
6784,keep me fully glad
6785,        keep me fully glad with nothing. only take my hand in your hand.
6786,        in the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. bind me close to you with nothing.
6787,        i will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. under this clouded sky i will meet silence with silence. i will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.
6788,        make my life glad with nothing.
6789,        the rains sweep the sky from end to end. jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. the cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.
6790,"why do you speak so softly, death, death,"
6791,"creep upon me, watch me so stealthily?"
6792,this is not how a lover should behave.
6793,when evening flowers droop upon their tired
6794,"stems, when cattle are brought in from the fields"
6795,"after a whole day’s grazing, you, death,"
6796,"death, approach me with such gentle steps,"
6797,settle yourself immovably by my side.
6798,i cannot understand the things you say.
6799,"alas, will this be how you will take me, death,"
6800,"death? like a thief, laying heavy sleep"
6801,on my eyes as you descend to my heart?
6802,will you thus let your tread be a slow beat
6803,"in my sleep-numbed blood, your jingling ankle-bells"
6804,"a drowsy rumble in my ear? will you, death,"
6805,"death, wrap me, finally, in your cold"
6806,arms and carry me away while i dream?
6807,i do not know why you thus come and go.
6808,"tell me, is this the way you wed, death,"
6809,"death? unceremonially, with no"
6810,weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer?
6811,will you come with your massy tawny hair
6812,"unkempt, unbound into a bright coil-crown?"
6813,will no one bear your victory-flag before
6814,"or after, will no torches glow like red"
6815,"eyes along the river, death, death?"
6816,will earth not quake in terror at your step?
6817,"when fierce-eyed siva came to take his bride,"
6818,"remember all the pomp and trappings, death,"
6819,death: the flapping tiger-skins he wore;
6820,his roaring bull; the serpents hissing round
6821,his hair; the bom-bom sound as he slapped his cheeks;
6822,the necklace of skulls swinging round his neck;
6823,the sudden raucous music as he blew
6824,his horn to announce his coming - was this not
6825,"a better way of wedding, death, death?"
6826,and as that deathly wedding-party’s din
6827,"grew nearer, death, death, tears of joy"
6828,filled gauri’s eyes and the garments at her breast
6829,quivered; her left eye fluttered and her heart
6830,pounded; her body quailed with thrilled delight
6831,"and her mind ran away with itself, death, death;"
6832,her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought
6833,of receiving so wild a groom; and in his mind
6834,her father agreed calamity had struck.
6835,"why must you always come like a thief, death,"
6836,"death, always silently, at night’s end,"
6837,"leaving only tears? come to me festively,"
6838,"make the whole night ring with your triumph, blow"
6839,"your victory-conch, dress me in blood-red robes,"
6840,grasp me by the hand and sweep me away!
6841,"pay no heed to what others may think, death,"
6842,"death, for i shall of my own free will"
6843,resort to you if you but take me gloriously.
6844,if i am immersed in work in my room
6845,"when you arrive, death, death, then break"
6846,"my work, thrust my unreadiness aside."
6847,"if i am sleeping, sinking all desires"
6848,"in the dreamy pleasure of my bed, or i lie"
6849,with apathy gripping my heart and my eyes
6850,"flickering between sleep and waking, fill"
6851,"your conch with your destructive breath and blow,"
6852,"death, death, and i shall run to you."
6853,"i shall go to where your boat is moored,"
6854,"death, death, to the sea where the wind rolls"
6855,darkness towards me from infinity.
6856,i may see black clouds massing in the far
6857,north-east corner of the sky; fiery snakes
6858,"of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised,"
6859,but i shall not flinch in unfounded fear -
6860,"i shall pass silently, unswervingly"
6861,"across that red storm-sea, death, death."
6862,kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound:
6863,the seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds.
6864,"his voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere,"
6865,it darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when.
6866,"he sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away:"
6867,"the courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise."
6868,"only the old king pratap ray sits like wood, unmoved."
6869,"haraj lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold."
6870,from childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing -
6871,"rag kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains,"
6872,"songs for durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell -"
6873,his heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears.
6874,and on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
6875,"there were cowherds' songs of krsna, in raags bhupali and multan."
6876,so many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house:
6877,"servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight:"
6878,"the bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels,"
6879,young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear:
6880,"before him, singing raag sahana, sits baraj lal."
6881,the king's heart is full of all those days and songs.
6882,"when he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside,"
6883,no sudden magical awakening of memories of the past.
6884,when pratap ray watches kasinath he just sees his wagging head:
6885,"tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart."
6886,kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space.
6887,pratap ray smilingly turns his eyes to baraj lal.
6888,"he puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'dear ustad,"
6889,"give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all."
6890,"it's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird."
6891,"we used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'"
6892,"old baraj lal, white-haired, white turban on his head,"
6893,bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat.
6894,"he takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand"
6895,and with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag yaman-kalyap.
6896,"his quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall,"
6897,"is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries."
6898,"pratap ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again:"
6899,"'superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'"
6900,"the courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves,"
6901,"some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms;"
6902,"some of them call to servants, 'bring the bookah, bring some pan.'"
6903,some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat.
6904,"they cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about -"
6905,"the hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown."
6906,"the old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon:"
6907,only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.
6908,music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
6909,"is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone."
6910,"the song and baraj lal's feelings go separate ways,"
6911,"but he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king."
6912,one of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind.
6913,"he quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time."
6914,"again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame;"
6915,he starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop.
6916,his hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name.
6917,"his voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze."
6918,"he abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune,"
6919,but suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries.
6920,"the intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away -"
6921,"tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls."
6922,in shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap -
6923,he has failed to remember a song:  he weeps as he did as a child.
6924,with brimming eyes king pratap ray tenderly touches his friend:
6925,"'come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love."
6926,they leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights.
6927,"the two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands."
6928,"baraj says with hands clasped, 'master, our days are gone."
6929,"new men have come now, new styles and customs in the world."
6930,the court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left.
6931,"don't ask anyone to listen to me now, i beg you at your feet, my lord."
6932,"the singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears:"
6933,"one man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind."
6934,only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound;
6935,only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.
6936,only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world.
6937,"where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'"
6938,"the 'i' that floats along the wave of time, "
6939,from a distance i watch him. 
6940,"with the dust and the water, "
6941,"with the fruit and the flower, "
6942,with the all he is rushing forward. 
6943,"he is always on the surface, "
6944,tossed by the waves and dancing to the rhythm 
6945,of joy and suffering. 
6946,"the least loss makes him suffer, "
6947,the least wound hurts him-- 
6948,him i see from afar. 
6949,that 'i' is not my real self; 
6950,"i am still within myself, "
6951,i do not float in the stream of death. 
6952,"i am free, i am desireless, "
6953,"i am peace, i am illumined-- "
6954,him i see from afar.

6956,the golden boat
6957,clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.
6958,"i sit on the river bank, sad and alone."
6959,"the sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,"
6960,the river is swollen and fierce in its flow.
6961,as we cut the paddy it started to rain. 
6962,"one small paddy-field, no one but me -"
6963,flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.
6964,trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink
6965,on a village painted on deep morning grey.
6966,"on this side a paddy-field, no one but me. "
6967,"who is this, steering close to the shore"
6968,singing? i feel that she is someone i know.
6969,"the sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,"
6970,waves break helplessly against the boat each side.
6971,i watch and feel i have seen her face before. 
6972,oh to what foreign land do you sail?
6973,come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.
6974,"go where you want to, give where you care to,"
6975,"but come to the bank a moment, show your smile -"
6976,take away my golden paddy when you sail. 
6977,"take it, take as much as you can load."
6978,"is there more? no, none, i have put it aboard."
6979,my intense labour here by the river -
6980,"i have parted with it all, layer upon layer;"
6981,"now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard. "
6982,"no room, no room, the boat is too small."
6983,"loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full."
6984,"across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,"
6985,"on the bare river-bank, i remain alone -"
6986,what had has gone: the golden boat took all.
6987,at the last watch
6988,"pity, in place of love,"
6989,"    that pettiest of gifts,"
6990,is but a sugar-coating over neglect.
6991,    any passerby can make a gift of it
6992,"        to a street beggar,"
6993,only to forget the moment the first corner is turned.
6994,        i had not hoped for anything more that day.
6995,you left during the last watch of night.
6996,"    i had hoped you would say goodbye,"
6997,"          just say 'adieu' before going away,"
6998,"    what you had said another day,"
6999,              what i shall never hear again.
7000,"                in their place, just that one word,"
7001,bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion
7002,          would even that have been too much for you to bear?
7003,          when i first awoke from sleep
7004,                    my heart fluttered with fear
7005,            lest the time had been over.
7006,              i rushed out of bed.
7007,      the distant church clock chimed half past twelve
7008,              i sat waiting near the door of my room
7009,"                  resting my head against it,"
7010,    facing the porch through which you would come out.
7011,even that tiniest of chances
7012,  was snatched away by fate from hapless me;
7013,  i fell asleep
7014,        shortly before you left.
7015,perhaps you cast a sidelong glance
7016,            at my reclining body
7017,    like a broken boat left high and dry.
7018,  perhaps you walked away with care
7019,            lest you wake me up.
7020,  awaking with a start i knew at once
7021,            that my vigil had been wasted
7022,"  i realised, what was to go went away in a moment,"
7023,        what was to stay behind stayed on
7024,            for all time.
7025,  like that of a birds' nest bereft of birds
7026,        on the bough of a songless tree.
7027,with the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended
7028,        the pallor of dawn
7029,  spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life.
7030,                  i walked towards your bedroom
7031,                                    for no reason.
7032,                      outside the door
7033,"              burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot,"
7034,            the porch smelt of the smouldering wick.
7035,over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolled-up mosquito-net
7036,                    fluttered a little in the breeze.
7037,            seen in the sky outside through the window
7038,"                        was the morning star,"
7039,                    witness of all sleepless people
7040,                        bereft of hope.
7041,suddenly i found you had left behind by mistake
7042,your gold-mounted ivory walking stick.
7043,"      if there were time, i thought,"
7044,"      you might come back from the station to look for it,"
7045,      but not because
7046,  you had not seen me before going away.
7047,the gardener xxix: speak to me my love
7048,"speak to me, my love! tell me in"
7049,words what you sang.
7050,    the night is dark. the stars are
7051,lost in clouds. the wind is sighing
7052,through the leaves.
7053,    i will let loose my hair. my blue
7054,cloak will cling round me like night. i 
7055,will clasp your head to my bosom; and
7056,there in the sweet loneliness murmur
7057,on your heart. i will shut my eyes
7058,and listen. i will not look in your face.
7059,"    when your words are ended, we will"
7060,sit still and silent. only the trees will
7061,whisper in the dark.
7062,    the night will pale. the day will
7063,dawn. we shall look at each other's 
7064,eyes and go on our different paths.
7065,"    speak to me, my love! tell me in"
7066,words what you sang.
7067,day by day i float my paper boats one by one down the running
7068,    in big black letters i write my name on them and the name of
7069,the village where i live.
7070,    i hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
7071,know who i am.
7072,"    i load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and"
7073,hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
7074,in the night.
7075,    i launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
7076,little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
7077,    i know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
7078,the air to race with my boats!
7079,    when night comes i bury my face in my arms and dream that my
7080,paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
7081,"    the fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins"
7082,their baskets full of dreams.
7083,i wonder if i know him
7084,"in whose speech is my voice,"
7085,"in whose movement is my being,"
7086,"whose skill is in my lines,"
7087,whose melody is in my songs
7088,in joy and sorrow.
7089,"i thought he was chained within me,"
7090,"contained by tears and laughter,"
7091,work and play.
7092,i thought he was my very self
7093,coming to an end with my death.
7094,why then in a flood of joy do i feel him
7095,in the sight and touch of my beloved?
7096,this 'i' beyond self i found
7097,on the shores of the shining sea.
7098,therefore i know
7099,this 'i' is not imprisoned within my bounds.
7100,"losing myself, i find him"
7101,beyond the borders of time and space.
7102,through the ages
7103,i come to know his shining self
7104,"in the life of the seeker,"
7105,in the voice of the poet.
7106,from the dark clouds pour the rains.
7107,i sit and think:
7108,"bearing so many forms, so many names,"
7109,"i come down, crossing the threshold"
7110,of countless births and deaths.
7111,"the supreme undivided, complete in himself,"
7112,"embracing past and present,"
7113,dwells in man.
7114,within him i shall find myself -
7115,the 'i' that reaches everywhere.
7116,"music is silenced, the dark descending slowly"
7117,has stripped unending skies of all companions.
7118,weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
7119,dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears.
7120,"still, o bird, o sightless bird,"
7121,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings."
7122,it's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
7123,"of an ocean's drowsy booming,"
7124,not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam.
7125,where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves?
7126,where the nest and the branch's hold?
7127,"still, o bird, my sightless bird,"
7128,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings."
7129,stretching in front of you the night's immensity
7130,hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun;
7131,still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
7132,across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
7133,has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon.
7134,"—but o my bird, o sightless bird,"
7135,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings."
7136,from upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
7137,intently watch your course and death's impatience
7138,lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves;
7139,and sad entreaties line the farthest shore
7140,"with hands outstretched and crooning 'come, o come!'"
7141,"still, o bird, o sightless bird,"
7142,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings."
7143,all that is past: your fears and loves and hopes;
7144,all that is lost: your words and lamentation;
7145,no longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers.
7146,"for wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard,"
7147,"and the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction."
7148,"dear bird, my sightless bird,"
7149,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!"
7150,poems on love
7151,love adorns itself;
7152,it seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty.
7153,"love does not claim possession,"
7154,but gives freedom.
7155,"love is an endless mystery,"
7156,for it has nothing else to explain it.
7157,"love's gift cannot be given,"
7158,it waits to be accepted.
7159,"palm-tree: single-legged giant,"
7160,"          topping other trees,"
7161,            peering at the firmament -
7162,it longs  to pierce the black cloud-ceiling
7163,"          and fly away, away, "
7164,            if only it had wings.
7165,the tree  seems to express its wish
7166,          in the tossing of its head:
7167,            its fronds heave and swish -
7168,"it thinks, maybe my leaves are feathers,"
7169,          and nothing stops me now
7170,            from rising on their flutter.
7171,all day    the fronds the windblown tree
7172,          soar and flap and shudder
7173,"            as though it thinks it can fly,"
7174,"as though  it wanders in the skies,"
7175,"          travelling who knows where,"
7176,            wheeling past the stars -
7177,"and then  as soon as the wind dies down,"
7178,"          the fronds subside, subside:"
7179,            the mind of the tree returns.
7180,"to earth,  recalls that earth is its mother:"
7181,          and then it likes once more
7182,            its earthly corner. 
7183,i cast my net into the sea
7184,in the morning i cast my net into the sea.
7185,"i dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty -- some shone like a smile, some glistened like tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride."
7186,"when with the day's burden i went home, my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower."
7187,"i hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that i had dragged up, and stood silent."
7188,"she glanced at them and said, ""what strange things are these? i know not of what use they are!"""
7189,"i bowed my head in shame and thought, ""i have not fought for these, i did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts for her."""
7190,then the whole night through i flung them one by one into the street.
7191,in the morning travellers came; they picked them up and carried them into far countries.
7192,poems on time
7193,"the butterfly counts not months but moments,"
7194,and has time enough. 
7195,"time is a wealth of change,"
7196,but the clock in its parody makes it mere change and no wealth.
7197,let your life lightly dance on the edges of time
7198,like dew on the tip of a leaf.
7199,poems on beauty
7200,beauty is truth's smile
7201,when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.
7202,beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony
7203,which is in the universal being;
7204,truth the perfect comprehension of the universal mind.
7205,a love song from the north
7206,"tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,"
7207,"wouldst thou recall to my heart, papeeha,"
7208,"dreams of delight that are gone,"
7209,when swift to my side came the feet of my lover
7210,with stars of the dusk and the dawn?
7211,"i see the soft wings of the clouds on the river,"
7212,"and jewelled with raindrops the mango-leaves quiver,"
7213,and tender boughs flower on the plain.....
7214,"but what is their beauty to me, papeeha,"
7215,"beauty of blossom and shower, papeeha,"
7216,that brings not my lover again? 
7217,"tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,"
7218,"wouldst thou revive in my heart, papeeha"
7219,grief for the joy that is gone?
7220,i hear the bright peacock in glimmering woodlands
7221,cry to its mate in the dawn;
7222,"i hear the black koel's slow, tremulous wooing,"
7223,and sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
7224,of passionate bulbul and dove....
7225,"but what is their music to me, papeeha"
7226,"songs of their laughter and love, papeeha,"
7227,"to me, forsaken of love? "
7228,like this alabaster box whose art 
7229,"is frail as a cassia-flower, is my heart, "
7230,carven with delicate dreams and wrought 
7231,with many a subtle and exquisite thought.
7232,therein i treasure the spice and scent 
7233,of rich and passionate memories blent 
7234,"like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove, "
7235,of song and sorrow and life and love. 
7236,an indian love song
7237,lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon 
7238,"of thy glory and grace,"
7239,"withhold not, o love, from the night "
7240,"of my longing the joy of thy luminous face,"
7241,give me a spear of the scented keora 
7242,"guarding thy pinioned curls, "
7243,or a silken thread from the fringes 
7244,that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls;
7245,faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume 
7246,"and the song of thy anklets' caprice,"
7247,"revive me, i pray, with the magical nectar "
7248,that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.
7249,"how shall i yield to the voice of thy pleading, "
7250,"how shall i grant thy prayer,"
7251,"or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, "
7252,a scented leaf from my hair?
7253,"or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face,"
7254,profane the law of my father's creed for a foe 
7255,of my father's race?
7256,"thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine,"
7257,the feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.
7258,"what are the sins of my race, beloved, "
7259,what are my people to thee? 
7260,"and what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, "
7261,what are thy gods to me?
7262,"love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, "
7263,"of stranger, comrade or kin,"
7264,alike in his ear sound the temple bells 
7265,and the cry of the muezzin.
7266,for love shall cancel the ancient wrong 
7267,"and conquer the ancient rage,"
7268,redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow 
7269,that sullied a bygone age. 
7270,"like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,"
7271,   the sunset hangs on a cloud;
7272,"a golden storm of glittering sheaves,"
7273,"of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,"
7274,   the wild wind blows in a cloud.
7275,hark to a voice that is calling
7276,   to my heart in the voice of the wind:
7277,"my heart is weary and sad and alone,"
7278,"for its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,"
7279,   and why should i stay behind? 
7280,"o little mouse, why dost thou cry "
7281,while merry stars laugh in the sky? 
7282,alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
7283,"ah, who will ease my bitter pain? "
7284,he went to seek a millet-grain 
7285,in the rich farmer's granary shed; 
7286,"they caught him in a baited snare, "
7287,and slew my lover unaware: 
7288,alas! alas! my lord is dead.
7289,"o little deer, why dost thou moan, "
7290,hid in thy forest-bower alone?
7291,alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
7292,ah! who will quiet my lament?
7293,at fall of eventide he went 
7294,to drink beside the river-head; 
7295,"a waiting hunter threw his dart, "
7296,and struck my lover through the heart. 
7297,alas! alas! my lord is dead.
7298,"o little bride, why dost thou weep "
7299,with all the happy world asleep? 
7300,alas! alas! my lord is dead!

7302,"or still the want of famished years, "
7303,and crown with love my marriage-bed?

7305,that lit my lover's funeral pyre:

7312,"the sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother, the waves are our comrades all. "
7313,what though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives? 
7314,"he who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives. "
7315,"sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove,"
7316,and sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; 
7317,"but sweeter, o brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; "
7318,"row, brothers, row to the edge of the verge, where the low sky mates with the sea. "

7501,drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; 
7502,"o wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, "
7503,and beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.
7504,"the scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair, "

7507,"and exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet."
7508,"now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, "
7509,"now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; "
7510,"their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, "
7511,"eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire! "
7512,indian love song
7513,"like a serpent to the calling voice of flutes, "

7515,"where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above "
7516,his jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers;

7548,and make the gods their incense-offering. 
7549,"children, ye have not lived, to you it seems "
7550,"life is a lovely stalactite of dreams, "
7551,or carnival of careless joys that leap 
7552,about your hearts like billows on the deep 
7553,in flames of amber and of amethyst. 
7554,"children, ye have not lived, ye but exist "
7555,till some resistless hour shall rise and move 
7556,"your hearts to wake and hunger after love, "
7557,and thirst with passionate longing for the things 
7558,that burn your brows with blood-red sufferings. 
7559,"till ye have battled with great grief and fears, "
7560,"and borne the conflict of dream-shattering years, "

7564,"have you found me, at last, o my dream? seven eons ago "
7565,you died and i buried you deep under forests of snow. 
7566,why have you come hither? who bade you awake from your sleep 
7567,and track me beyond the cerulean foam of the deep? 
7568,would you tear from my lintels these sacred green garlands of leaves? 
7569,"would you scare the white, nested, wild pigeons of joy from my eaves? "
7570,would you touch and defile with dead fingers the robes of my priest? 
7571,would you weave your dim moan with the chantings of love at my feast? 
7572,"go back to your grave, o my dream, under forests of snow, "
7573,"where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven eons ago. "
7574,who bade you arise from your darkness? i bid you depart! 
7575,profane not the shrines i have raised in the clefts of my heart.

7578,jewelled with embers of opal and peridote. 
7579,"see the white river that flashes and scintillates, "
7580,curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates. 
7581,"hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call "

7583,"from trellised balconies, languid and luminous "
7584,"faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous. "
7585,"leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, "
7586,swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains. 
7587,round the high char minar sounds of gay cavalcades 
7588,blend with the music of cymbals and serenades. 
7589,"over the city bridge night comes majestical, "
7590,borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.

7601,of whom you are the crown and chief 
7602,"and they, who bear on vedic brows "
7603,their mystic symbols of belief; 
7604,"and they, who worshipping the sun, "
7605,fled o'er the old iranian sea; 
7606,"and they, who bow to him who trod "
7607,the midnight waves of galilee.
7608,"sweet, sumptuous fables of baghdad "
7609,"the splendours of your court recall, "
7610,the torches of a thousand nights

7622,your faithful stewards sleepless guard 
7623,the harvests of your gold and grain.

7632,"lightly, o lightly we bear her along,"
7633,she sways like a flower in the wind of our song;

7635,she floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.
7636,"gaily, o gaily we glide and we sing,"
7637,we bear her along like a pearl on a string.
7638,"softly, o softly we bear her along,"

7643,we bear her along like a pearl on a string. 
7644,past and future
7645,the new hath come and now the old retires: 
7646,"and so the past becomes a mountain-cell, "
7647,"where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell "
7648,"in consecrated calm, forgotten yet "
7649,of the keen heart that hastens to forget 
7650,old longings in fulfilling new desires. 
7651,"and now the soul stands in a vague, intense "
7652,"expectancy and anguish of suspense, "
7653,on the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees 
7654,"like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown, "
7655,"his timid future shrinking there alone, "
7656,beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries. 
7657,song of a dream
7658,once in the dream of a night i stood 
7659,"lone in the light of a magical wood, "
7660,soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang; 
7661,"and spirits of truth were the birds that sang, "
7662,"and spirits of love were the stars that glowed, "
7663,and spirits of peace were the streams that flowed 
7664,in that magical wood in the land of sleep.
7665,"lone in the light of that magical grove, "
7666,i felt the stars of the spirits of love 
7667,"gather and gleam round my delicate youth, "
7668,and i heard the song of the spirits of truth; 
7669,to quench my longing i bent me low 
7670,by the streams of the spirits of peace that flow 
7671,in that magical wood in the land of sleep. 
7672,"when dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky, "
7673,"rousing the world to labour's various cry, "
7674,"to tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain, "
7675,"from ardent toil to forge a little gain, "
7676,"and fasting men go forth on hurrying feet, "
7677,"buy bread, buy bread, rings down the eager street. "
7678,when the earth falters and the waters swoon 
7679,"with the implacable radiance of noon, "
7680,"and in dim shelters koïls hush their notes, "
7681,"and the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats "
7682,"craves liquid succour from the cruel heat, "
7683,"buy fruit, buy fruit, steals down the panting street."
7684,"when twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars, "
7685,"unfurls a sudden canopy of stars, "
7686,when lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit 
7687,on white roof-terraces where lovers sit 
7688,"drinking together of life's poignant sweet, "
7689,"buy flowers, buy flowers, floats down the singing street. "
7690,"lamp of my life, the lips of death "
7691,hath blown thee out with their sudden breath; 
7692,naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . . 
7693,"love, must i dwell in the living dark? "
7694,"tree of my life, death's cruel foot "
7695,hath crushed thee down to thy hidden root; 
7696,nought shall restore thy glory fled . . . 
7697,shall the blossom live when the tree is dead? 
7698,"life of my life, death's bitter sword "
7699,"hath severed us like a broken word, "
7700,rent us in twain who are but one . . 
7701,shall the flesh survive when the soul is gone? 
7702,the bangle sellers
7703,bangle sellers are we who bear
7704,our shining loads to the temple fair...
7705,"who will buy these delicate, bright"
7706,rainbow-tinted circles of light?

7708,for happy daughters and happy wives.
7709,"some are meet for a maiden's wrist,"
7710,"silver and blue as the mountain mist,"
7711,some are flushed like the buds that dream
7712,"on the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,"
7713,some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
7714,to the limpid glory of new born leaves
7715,"some are like fields of sunlit corn,"
7716,"meet for a bride on her bridal morn,"
7717,"some, like the flame of her marriage fire,"
7718,"or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,"
7719,"tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,"
7720,like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.
7721,some are purple and gold flecked grey
7722,"for she who has journeyed through life midway,"
7723,"whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,"

7726,and worships the gods at her husband's side. 
7727,the coromandel fishers

7731,"to capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for we are the kings of the sea! "
7732,"no longer delay, let us hasten away in the track of the sea gull's call, "
7733,"the sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother, the waves are our comrades all. "
7734,what though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives? 
7735,"he who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives. "
7736,"sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove,"
7737,and sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; 
7738,"but sweeter, o brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; "

7740,the illusion of love

7743,of flickering flame set in loam of clay – 
7744,i care not …since you kindle all my dark
7745,with the immortal lustres of the day.
7746,"and as all men deem, dearest, you may be"
7747,only a common shell
7748,chance-winnowed by the sea-winds from the sea –
7749,the subtle murmurs of eternity.
7750,"and tho’ you are, like men or mortal race,"
7751,only a hapless thing
7752,that death may mar and destiny efface – 
7753,i care not … since unto my heart you bring

7766,time's river winds in foaming centuries

7773,of languid and sequestered ease;

7777,"shot opal, gold and amethyst. "
7778,"from thieving light of eyes impure, "
7779,"from coveting sun or wind's caress, "
7780,her days are guarded and secure 
7781,"behind her carven lattices, "
7782,"like jewels in a turbaned crest, "
7783,like secrets in a lover's breast. 
7784,but though no hand unsanctioned dares

7807,a voiceless captive to my conquering song.
7808,"i need thee not, i am content with these:"
7809,"keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!"
7810,"but in the desolate hour of midnight, when"
7811,an ectasy of starry silence sleeps

7814,let thy soul answer mine across the seas.

7850,like seven bright petals of beauty's flower 
7851,queen gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose 
7852,"""where is my rival, o king feroz?"" "
7853,"when spring winds wakened the mountain floods, "
7854,"and kindled the flame of the tulip buds,"

8048,"of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights, "
8049,performing thine inexorable rites.

8067,"dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy, "
8068,"henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay, "
8069,backward to transient pleasure and to thee? 
8070,"i give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow; "
8071,"but, o beloved comrade, ere we part, "
8072,upon my mournful eyelids and my brow 
8073,kiss me who hold thine image in my heart. 
8074,"nay, do not grieve tho' life be full of sadness,"

8166,"anger is bad, "
8167,anger is when i'm mad.
8168,anger makes me scream and shout.
8169,anger makes me lose control.
8170,anger turns people against me.
8171,anger makes me suffer...
8172,again anger is evil!
8173,plenty of anger
8174,there is plenty of anger inside of me
8175,it has to stop
8176,why is there so much anger inside of me? 
8177,my anger is part of my frustration
8178,i have to control it now
8179,my anger causes me plenty of trouble
8180,there is plenty of anger inside of me
8181,and what is anger do i know? 
8182,anger is a strong feeling of displasure
8183,it is a grief that i have inside of me
8184,how can i control it? 
8185,what triggers my anger? 
8186,can i recognize it?
8187,anger is a force that can never die
8188,anger is a force that lies deep within us
8189,anger is the force that can change a man life 
8190,anger is the force that can create a kill
8191,anger is the force that can ruin your life
8192,anger is the thing we all fear
8193,anger is the force that will kill us all
8194,anger is the force that we shall take to are grave
8195,the new fake me
8196,the blade is cold
8197,but not old
8198,i didn’t go deep
8199,i didn’t even weep
8200,just one cut is all i need
8201,"and my mind goes calm, while my cut bleeds"
8202,it was harmless but helped so much
8203,i stopped being mad and such
8204,no more angry thoughts went through my mind
8205,"just fascination, everything else left behind"
8206,is the start or the end?
8207,all i know is i don’t want to disappoint my friend
8208,is it too late for me?
8209,i thought i was getting better but i only pretended to be
8210,the cut now stains my arm
8211,"nothing big or deep, nothing to cause much harm"
8212,a cat scratch is what i’ll say
8213,but i doubt people will see any day
8214,they won’t see the real me and who i am
8215,they won’t see my body is disconnected from my brain stem
8216,"i don’t want attention, i don’t deserve it"
8217,"i play along with the world, but my candle is not lit"
8218,i’m a lost soul on this land
8219,"my minds drifting, my body sinking in sand"
8220,i’ve given up on people
8221,it’s now me alone in my own steeple
8222,i get so mad so quick
8223,"like a switch on the wall, tense with every click"
8224,maybe i’m only meant to be there for others
8225,don’t the daughters learn from the mothers?
8226,only my mother does not know me
8227,she only sees who she wants to see
8228,there’s no way her sweet child
8229,cut her arm to keep her mind from going wild
8230,do they realize their actions affect me so?
8231,that sometimes they cause me to hit my low?
8232,"no they don’t, all they see is him"
8233,they can’t even see the pattern; my cups reached its brim.
8234,he angers then he lies
8235,to get people to take him back. i bet he even denies
8236,the wrongs that he’s done
8237,all because he thinks life is fun
8238,but when will he see
8239,that he’s just another wanna be
8240,it’s possible i just don’t belong
8241,there are parts of me i’ve discovered are gone
8242,like my patience to wait
8243,i’m done waiting there’s nothing to debate
8244,once i’m of age you’ll barely see me
8245,once i get a car i’ll never be here to be
8246,i witness to the yells or shouts
8247,a witness to the pattern of oh okay and get out
8248,a witness to tears and uproars
8249,a witness to hurtful words and slamming doors
8250,a witness to a father who’s confused
8251,because my mother is either okay or blowing a fuse
8252,i’ll stop being the victim of being on the edge
8253,"because i’ll stop being around, i won’t be on the ledge"
8254,i won’t be the victim of feeling guilty anymore
8255,i won’t be the victim or witness anytime i walk out that door
8256,am i lost? that’s easy to say
8257,is there hope? we’ll see with each coming day.
8258,my name does not matter all that matters is the story my friend
8259,"the one with a strong beginning, unclear middle, but no end."
8260,it’s a screwed up world even a blind man could see
8261,that to fake happiness you have to be who others expect you to be
8262,i don't understand
8263,how are you daddy?
8264,it's been forever since we've spoken.
8265,"i guess we let this whole time pass,"
8266,and now we're completely broken.
8267,do you miss me the way i wish you would?
8268,i can't imagine you do.
8269,"you've never sent cards or letters,"
8270,even though i'm missing you.
8271,"my past attempts seem to mean nothing,"
8272,it's nice to know you care.
8273,"and even though you don't know how,"
8274,i've always wished you were there.
8275,"so, how are you daddy?"
8276,it's been a while.
8277,i miss your laugh
8278,and i've forgotten your smile.
8279,"i'm not even gonna ask,"
8280,if you've ever missed me.
8281,through the unanswered phone calls and the time that's passed
8282,the answers i can see.
8283,"it's funny how fast the time goes,"
8284,but six years have come and gone.
8285,"maybe you thought i didn't need you,"
8286,but you were oh so wrong.
8287,how are you daddy?
8288,i hope you're doing well.
8289,"i'm learning how to deal with the pain,"
8290,i think you can probably tell.
8291,"don't ever try to make things right,"
8292,they'll never be the same.
8293,"in fact if it makes you feel any better,"
8294,you can just forget my name.
8295,"to you i doubt i even exist,"
8296,i don't have a place in your world.
8297,"i hope you're doing well daddy, "
8298,"love, your little girl"
8299,please make the yelling stop 
8300,no matter how well i do in school or how well i clean the house
8301,still they aren't happy
8302,from the time i walk in the door till the time i go to bed every night 
8303,the screaming never seems to stop
8304,it used to be just from my mother
8305,but now my father too 
8306,sometimes even my older brother
8307,the one i considered my hero
8308,"they tell me i'm crazy, stupid, a mess up"
8309,i just want to be good enough for them 
8310,but it seems i never will be
8311,they say they care and they say they love me
8312,"but i'm not blind, i can see the hate they have for me"
8313,"i was a mistake, they didn't believe in abortion"
8314,"so, here i am, the mistake child"
8315,in the dark i sit in my room and cry
8316,day in and day out
8317,their words and looks 
8318,slice into me deeper than any razor ever could
8319,"this has went on for years now, "
8320,when will it end?? 
8321,sometimes i wonder what it would be like
8322,if i just got up and left... 
8323,or if i ended it all for good..
8324,or even if i called the police...
8325,but i'm not strong enough to do any of that
8326,i can't last any longer
8327,these people are not my family 
8328,the people i see everyday are monsters
8329,"they don't love me, my family did"
8330,"where did my family go, they are missing :( "
8331,all this yelling is really getting to me
8332,it's breaking me down day by day
8333,soon there will be nothing left
8334,i just want to be left in silence..
8335,"please, make the yelling stop"
8336,who would know??
8337,"if i told you my life story,"
8338,would you listen...
8339,would you understand?
8340,would you cry as i have cried?
8341,"i am human,"
8342,"though others don't see it,"
8343,"the say i'm emo,"
8344,"they say i'm gothic,"
8345,they say i'm a devil worshiper
8346,who are they to judge me?
8347,"i am who i am,"
8348,but who would know that?
8349,"you have given birth to me,"
8350,you gave me life
8351,"father you were never there for me,"
8352,"sister you watched me as i took the pills,"
8353,"brother, you have criticized me,"
8354,you have hurt me.
8355,"if i told you why i did it,"
8356,you would not understand
8357,for you have never understood me.
8358,who would even care if i died?
8359,i was a nobody...
8360,now i'm dead
8361,can you not see
8362,can you not see this pain i have inside
8363,for so long it had to hide
8364,pain surrounds me day by day
8365,it just doesn't seem to go away
8366,pain that comes and pain that goes
8367,pain that keeps you on your toes
8368,there is pain in my heart
8369,and it seems to never part
8370,pain stuffed inside of me
8371,can't let anyone near me
8372,can't let anyone see the real me
8373,can't let anyone even hug me
8374,it seems that nobody cares
8375,still yet to bare
8376,i can't take this pain anymore
8377,i just want to walk out the door
8378,no one will ever understand 
8379,you think you understand me?
8380,"i can hear you speak, you see?"
8381,you go on about my perfect life.
8382,you have no idea of the pain and the strife.
8383,you don't know about how i stress.
8384,worried to know if you'll like the way i dress.
8385,worried to know if you'll see past my look.
8386,"to find out it i like sports, hugs, or books."
8387,all you see is the careless look i show.
8388,so you automatically know me? no.
8389,"you only see the sarcasm, and the ""i don't care"""
8390,you only see perfect clothes and hair.
8391,you don't take the time to find out my fears.
8392,"which is why every night, ends in tears."
8393,she thinks its all okay.
8394,"she expects me to forget the pain,"
8395,she caused me every day.
8396,"things seen and heard being drilled in my head,"
8397,"she doesn't love me, she doesn't care,"
8398,is what she has said.
8399,it is so hard for me
8400,but i am forced to be normal
8401,..she chooses not to see..
8402,she tore my life apart.
8403,with all this hate and despise
8404,it was hard to make a new start.
8405,what have i done to deserve this.
8406,"a monster in my life, "
8407,she thanks my crying for her bliss.
8408,my heart sinking deeper then the ocean
8409,at just the sound of her name.
8410,hiding my true emotion.
8411,"sitting, waiting. . all night i pray."
8412,for her to stop
8413,to go away.
8414,but will she ever leave?
8415,so i can stop this same old prayer
8416,maybe then it won't be so hard to breathe
8417,maybe then life will seem fair.
8418,"thoughts of her go through my mind,"
8419,i try to block them out.
8420,but i was stuck there for such a long time.
8421,they make me mad.
8422,so no she hasn't succeeded
8423,for i am no longer sad.
8424,"i have cried enough tears to fill up the sea,"
8425,there is nothing left to do
8426,but let the bad thoughts flee.
8427,i tell myself to forget 
8428,but the dreams that haunt me every night 
8429,are about one thing. . her ..and the time that i regret.
8430,she made me realize i have no trust.
8431,"not even for myself,"
8432,she made me forget the feeling of lust.
8433,"so i want to thank her, "
8434,for i can no longer be hurt.
8435,maybe one day we will meet again.
8436,"i cant wait for that day to come,"
8437,just so i can remind her
8438,she is no longer my mum
8439,the hurt you put me through
8440,the tears that i have cried
8441,the pain that i have to deal with
8442,the times of hate won't succeed
8443,i can't be hurt much more
8444,i would like to say
8445,i plan on being ok soon
8446,and again this will be complete
8447,"she is such a weirdo, yet your super hero."
8448,i may be another girl you look at and walk away from
8449,i'm interested in hip-hop dance and track.
8450,"this world is full of uncaring, inconsiderate assholes and i'm done with having to deal with them."
8451,i'd like to direct myself to paths i've wished to take.
8452,"i'm clingy and friendly,"
8453,but not ready for relationship stuff.
8454,i've been hurt many times by people i thought were good friends and i'm still healing from those bad memories.
8455,i believe no one has the authority to say
8456,judgmental or nasty comments to another person.
8457,it's quite immature
8458,i don't expect everyone to like me. that's just life 
8459,"i'm living to do it right, not just have fun."
8460,i don't drink smoke or take drugs. mainly because i respect my body. 
8461,that's my choice.
8462,i'm not the prettiest or smartest girl. 
8463,but i have a perfect family and great friends who love me for who i am and give me great advice.
8464,i admit i'm not perfect. but i try my best. life's unexpected. 
8465,but it's the people around you who make it expected
8466,it hurts me
8467,"it hurts me to hear you crying,"
8468,it hurts me that you have thoughts of dying.
8469,"i know you need a friend,"
8470,so i'll be with you till the very end.
8471,"i'll be with you through thick and thin,"
8472,and this fight i promise we'll win.
8473,"i hope you know i'll always be there,"
8474,you no longer have to live in despair.
8475,"i just want you to know,"
8476,the love that i have to show.
8477,the silent girl
8478,she walks in the classroom
8479,proud and strong
8480,she talks like she's been good all along
8481,she smiles and waves and looks happy
8482,but deep down inside she's anything
8483,but proud and snappy
8484,she has cuts on her arms
8485,and bruises near her eyes
8486,but that's all she needs to be satisfied
8487,when she's at home
8488,she feels so alone
8489,she lost so many loves
8490,all of the above
8491,an abusive life
8492,and feels like no one cares
8493,"beaten, tortured and broken inside"
8494,all she ever did was run and hide
8495,for something that is to hard to describe
8496,all she ever needs is love
8497,like that message of white doves
8498,all she ever did is hide
8499,for what's going on in her life
8500,i am different
8501,we may have the same eye's 
8502,but i use mine differently
8503,we may have the same heart
8504,but i use mine differently
8505,i'm different cause i do things differently
8506,i'm different cause i wear things differently
8507,i may stand out differently in many ways
8508,but i love it 
8509,and i love begin different
8510,i am different
8511,i am black because i stand out from all the bright colors.
8512,i am a circle; all my great points are as good as the next one.
8513,i am a jog because i take life easy.
8514,"i am a bang, no one can ignore me."
8515,"i am a bird, flyin high above the clouds and everyone else."
8516,"i am ""love me or hate me,"" by lil wayne, i don’t care how people feel about me."
8517,"i am infinity, i have endless possibilities."
8518,"i am a fully customized ’64 impala, because nobody can be like me. "
8519,"i am a shelf, at times i have so much on my mind and others it’s blank."
8520,i am a lobster; it’s hard to get to my soft side.
8521,"i am the bass, because i keep the rhythm of my life."
8522,i am the sky; endless.
8523,"i am a rock, to tough for anyone to break."
8524,i am an oak tree; once my mind is planted i won’t move.
8525,"i am afraid of lightening, because it’s so quick and deadly."
8526,"frightened is the world behind my eyes, because i’m scared about my future"
8527,your dimension of greatness 
8528,"no one can know the potential,"
8529,of a life that is committed to win;
8530,"with courage - the challenge it faces,"
8531,to achieve great success in the end!
8532,"so, explore the dimension of greatness,"
8533,and believe that the world can be won;
8534,"by a mind that is fully committed,"
8535,knowing the task can be done!
8536,"your world has no place for the skeptic,"
8537,no room for the doubter to stand;
8538,to weaken your firm resolution
8539,that you can excel in this land!
8540,"we must have vision to see our potential,"
8541,and faith to believe that we can;
8542,"then courage to act with conviction,"
8543,to become what god meant us to be!
8544,"so, possess the strength and the courage,"
8545,to conquer whatever you choose;
8546,"it's the person who never gets started,"
8547,that is destined forever to lose!
8548,you can be whatever you want to be! 
8549,there is inside you
8550,all of the potential
8551,"to be whatever you want to be,"
8552,all of the energy
8553,to do whatever you want to do.
8554,"imagine yourself as you would like to be,"
8555,"doing what you want to do,"
8556,"and each day, take one step"
8557,towards your dream.
8558,and though at times it may seem too
8559,"difficult to continue,"
8560,hold on to your dream.
8561,one morning you will awake to find
8562,"that you are the person you dreamed of,"
8563,"doing what you wanted to do,"
8564,simply because you had the courage
8565,to believe in your potential
8566,and to hold on to your dream.
8567,within you is the strength to meet life's challenges! 
8568,"you are stronger than you think,"
8569,remember to stand tall.
8570,every challenge in your life
8571,helps you to grow.
8572,every problem you encounter
8573,strengthens your mind and your soul.
8574,every trouble you overcome
8575,increases your understanding of life.
8576,when all your troubles weigh
8577,"heavily on your shoulders,"
8578,remember that beneath the burden
8579,"you can stand tall,"
8580,because you are never given
8581,more than you can handle...
8582,and you are stronger than you think.
8583,words to live by 
8584,it's not how much you accomplish in life
8585,"that really counts,"
8586,but how much you give to other.
8587,it's not how high you build your dreams
8588,"that makes a difference,"
8589,but how high your faith can climb.
8590,"it's not how many goals you reach,"
8591,but how many lives you touch.
8592,"it's not who you know that matters,"
8593,but who you are inside.
8594,"believe in the impossible,"
8595,"hold tight to the incredible,"
8596,and live each day to its fullest potential.
8597,you can make a difference
8598,in your world.
8599,a creed to live by 
8600,don't undermine your worth by comparing
8601,yourself with others.
8602,it is because we are different that each of us is special.
8603,don't set your goals by what other people
8604,only you know what is best for you.
8605,don't take for granted the things closest to your heart.
8606,"cling to them as you would your life, for without them"
8607,life is meaningless.
8608,don't let your life slip through your fingers
8609,by living in the past or for the future.
8610,"by living your life one day at a time,"
8611,you live all the days of your life.
8612,don't give up when you still have something to give.
8613,nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.
8614,don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect.
8615,it is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.
8616,don't be afraid to encounter risks.
8617,it is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.
8618,don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find.
8619,the quickest way to receive love is to give love.
8620,the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly;
8621,and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
8622,don't dismiss your dreams.
8623,to be without dreams is to be without hope;
8624,to be without hope is to be without purpose.
8625,don't run through life so fast that you forget
8626,"not only where you've been, but also where you're going."
8627,"life is not a race, but a journey to be savored"
8628,each step of the way.
8629,don't give up! your dreams may be closer than you think! 
8630,there may be times when you feel
8631,as if you have taken a million steps towards 
8632,"your dreams, and acted on your plans, only to find "
8633,yourself in the same place that you began from.
8634,"at times like this, you must not give up. "
8635,you must continue on. though you may feel 
8636,"lost, bewildered, and alone, continue to believe"
8637,in yourself. do not allow discouragement and 
8638,doubt to blur your vision and wash away
8639,your dreams. visualize your way beyond the 
8640,"detours, standstills, and obstacles."
8641,you will realize your dreams. you have
8642,worked hard and taken so many productive 
8643,steps in a positive direction that you are bound
8644,to succeed. whatever the hurt of the moment
8645,"may be, it will pass. tomorrow is always a "
8646,"new dawn. today, you must pause, rest, catch"
8647,"your breath, and then look ahead. each step"
8648,will bring you closer to your dreams. the
8649,rainbows and the love that you deserve are in
8650,sight. happiness is just around the next turn. 
8651,you can do anything you believe you can 
8652,just start somewhere. resolve to do something.
8653,you might even write out what you want to
8654,accomplish. then explore what you need to do to
8655,"reach you goal, and start doing it, step by step."
8656,it's the same as if you were planning a trip: you 
8657,"get a map, make your preparations, and then start"
8658,traveling the right road. 
8659,"don't get ""bound up"" in any problems that stand "
8660,in your way. do something every day to resolve 
8661,them. trust your instincts. do one thing at a time.
8662,"f you sow seeds of fear, doubt, panic,"
8663,"and procrastination, it will most likely work against"
8664,you. if you keep doing the same things you're 
8665,"doing now, you will keep ending up in similar"
8666,places to where you are now.

8689,"or in black and white,"
8690,"whether they are big or small,"
8691,"easily attainable or almost impossible,"
8692,"look to your dreams,"
8693,and make them become reality.
8694,wishes and hopes are nothing
8695,until you take the first step
8696,towards making them something! 
8697,"dare to dream,"
8698,"because only by dreaming,"
8699,will you ever discover
8700,"who you are, what you want,"

8738,"and no one seems to care,"
8739,"just whisper to yourself,"
8740,"""i am the controller of my destiny."

8748,stay on your chosen path.
8749,all the power is within you;
8750,be true to what is in your heart.
8751,be honest within yourself;
8752,"if you are, then you cannot fail."
8753,your dreams will come true. 
8754,never let go of hope

8756,what you have always wished for has finally come to be. 
8757,"you will look back and laugh at what has passed and you will ask yourself,"
8758,"""how did i get through all of that?"" "
8759,just never let go of hope. 
8760,just never quit dreaming. 
8761,and never let love depart from your life.

8767,believe in what makes you happy.
8768,"believe in the dreams you've always wanted to come true,"
8769,and give them every chance to. 
8770,life holds no promises
8771,as to what will come your way.
8772,you must search for your own ideals
8773,and work towards reaching them.
8774,life makes no guarantees as to what you'll have.
8775,it just gives you time to make choices
8776,and to take chances 
8777,and to discover whatever secrets might come your way. 
8778,if you are willing to take the opportunities you are given
8779,"and utilize the abilities you have,"
8780,you will constantly fill your life 
8781,with special moments and unforgettable times.
8782,"no one knows the mysteries of life or its ultimate meaning,"
8783,but for those who are willing
8784,"to believe in their dreams and in themselves,"
8785,life is a precious gift in which anything is possible. 
8786,reaching your dream takes courage 
8787,courage is admitting that you're afraid and facing that fear directly. it's being strong enough to ask for help and humble enough to accept it. 
8788,"courage is standing up for what you believe in without worrying about the opinions of others. it's following your own heart, living your own life, and settling for nothing less than the best for yourself. "
8789,"courage is daring to take a first step, a big leap, or a different path. it's attempting to do something that no one has done before and all others thought impossible. "
8790,courage is keeping heart in the face of disappointment and looking at defeat not as an end but as a new beginning. it's believing that things will ultimately get better even as they get worse. 
8791,"courage is being responsible for your own actions and admitting your own mistakes without placing blame on others. it's relying not on others for your success, but on your own skills and efforts. "
8792,"courage is refusing to quit even when you're intimidated by impossibility. it's choosing a goal, sticking with it, and finding solutions to the problems. "
8793,"courage is thinking big, aiming high, and shooting far. it's taking a dream and doing anything, risking everything, and stopping at nothing to it make it a reality. "
8794,today's dreams are tomorrow's successes 
8795,don't be afraid of high hopes
8796,or plans that seem to be out of reach.
8797,"life is meant to be experienced,"
8798,and every situation allows for
8799,learning and growth. 
8800,"motivation is a positive starting point,"
8801,and action places you on a forward path.
8802,a dream is a blueprint
8803,of a goal not yet achieved;
8804,the only difference between the two
8805,is the effort involved in attaining
8806,what you hope to accomplish. 
8807,let your mind and heart urge you on;
8808,allow the power of your will
8809,to lead you to your destination. 
8810,don't count the steps ahead;
8811,just add up the total
8812,"of steps already covered,"
8813,and multiply it by
8814,"faith, confidence, and endurance. "
8815,always remember that
8816,"for those who persist,"
8817,today's dreams are transformed
8818,into tomorrow's successes. 
8819,believe in yourself and your dreams will come true 
8820,know what you can and want to do in life. 
8821,set goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them. 
8822,strive to have fun every day. 
8823,use your creativity as a means of expressing your feelings. 
8824,be sensitive in viewing the world. 
8825,develop a sense of confidence. 
8826,be honest with yourself and with others. 
8827,follow your heart and adhere to your own truths. 
8828,know that the more you give the more you will receive. 
8829,believe in yourself and your dreams will come true. 
8830,take these thoughts with you on your journey to your dreams 
8831,don't ever forget that you are unique. be your best self and not an imitation of someone else. 
8832,find your strength and use them in a positive way. don't listen to those who ridicule the choices you make. 
8833,travel the road that you have chosen and don't look back with regret. you have to take chances to make your dreams happen. 
8834,remember that there is plenty of time to travel another road - and still another - in your journey through life. 
8835,"take the time to find the route that is right for you. you will learn something valuable from every trip you take, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. "
8836,tell yourself that you're okay just the way you are. make friends who respect your true self. 
8837,"take the time to be alone, too, so you can know just how terrific your own company can be. "
8838,"remember that being alone doesn't always mean being lonely; it can be a beautiful experience of finding your creativity, your heartfelt feelings, and the calm and quiet peace deep inside you. "
8839,don't ever forget that you are special and you have within you the ability to make your dreams come true. 
8840,go after your dreams 
8841,"you're good, but you're going to be great. "
8842,"you're the best, but you're going to get better. "
8843,"sometimes the paths we take are long and hard, but remember: those are always the ones that lead to the most beautiful views. "
8844,challenges come along inevitably: how you respond to them determines who you are - deep down inside - and everything you're going to be. 
8845,increase the chances of reaching your goals by working at them gradually. the very best you can do is all that is asked of you. 
8846,"realize that you are capable of working miracles of your own making. remember that opportunities have a reason for knocking on your door, and the right ones are there for the taking. "
8847,"you don't always have to win, but you do need to know what it takes to be a winner. "
8848,it's up to you to find the key that unlocks the door to a more fulfilling life. 
8849,understand that increased difficulty brings you nearer to the truth of how to survive it - and get beyond it. 
8850,cross your bridges. 
8851,meet your challenges. 
8852,"reach out for your dreams, and bring them closer and closer to your heart. "
8853,"get rid of the ""if only's"" and get on with whatever you need to do to get things right. "
8854,"go after what you want in life, with all the blessings of all the people who care about you. and find out what making your wishes come true really feels like. "
8855,the serenity prayer 
8856,god grant me the serenity
8857,to accept the things
8858,"i cannot change,"
8859,"courage to change the things i can,"
8860,and wisdom to know the difference.
8861,"life is not just waking up one morning and saying ok i want this to happen, "
8862,it's about getting out there and going for it. . . .
8863,"life is full of surprises, "
8864,"here, there and everywhere, "
8865,"you never know where you will end up, "
8866,"or who you will end up with, "
8867,you just have to trust your faith and keep god close.
8868,"never say never cause you know you can do it, "
8869,"never say later do it right now, "
8870,"never let people bring you down, "
8871,"they will do anything to watch you fall, "
8872,"so keep your head up and your heart strong, "
8873,and then my dear you can never go wrong.
8874,silently laughing at my pain.
8875,"he enjoys it,"
8876,"no...he loves it, the pain he makes others feel."
8877,"he does not speak,"
8878,"but i know when i feel his eyes piercing mine, "
8879,he is laughing inside.
8880,"i shiver in fear,"
8881,"when his eyes, "
8882,"it is true im scared,"
8883,"of his eyes and him, "
8884,his eyes tell the things he does not.
8885,"his eyes, "
8886,"blood red, "
8887,"sitting in a corner so scared and afraid,"
8888,"he's standing there yelling at me,"
8889,"and he's the one to blame,"
8890,"marks across my face,"
8891,"from where he had hit me,"
8892,people always say that i’ve got it easy.
8893,"bruises on my back,"
8894,"the blood courses through my veins,"
8895,"in this dark old room,"
8896,there is something untamed.
8897,"scared to say a word,"
8898,"just one word to come out,"
8899,for no one knows what happens when the beast has made his rounds.
8900,"people always stare at me,"
8901,"i now know what they say,"
8902,"for all these scars left on my wrist,"
8903,the past has been revealed.
8904,"i do it one last time,"
8905,so no blood runs through these veins
8906,"harry, i'm scared"
8907,"i had always been the odd one out, in this world of people who seemed to be better than me. i could always hope that one day i would be accepted, but now a days, that hope has turned into misery."
8908,"i turned to my best friend and i said; ""harry, i'm scared, i can't do it, they would hurt me if i said it."""
8909,"he just looked at me and frowned and said; ""you need to learn to stand your ground, teagan, you're a tough girl you're a fighter, who cares about the unwanted fire."""
8910,"when harry said unwanted fire, he meant the heated arguments between my parents."
8911,"""all you need to do is be brave, and you'll be on your way."" "
8912,"""but i'm not brave like you harry!"""
8913,"""you are in your own way."""
8914,"i went home that night befuddled by what harry had said, it didn't explain anything, it made no sense in my head."
8915,"my mum saw me from outside, and came out shouting about the time of night."
8916,"""do you know what time it is? i was so worried."" she would say, but it was only an act, i knew she didn't care, she continues to tell me what a waste of space i am, and that she wasted her money when she adopted me."
8917,"""i don't care."" i said, as i walked past her, i aimed for the door, and next thing you know, i get slapped in the face, it stings for awhile and i turn around, to see another frown."
8918,"""now listen to me, do as i say, i know what's right, and from this day, you will not stay out late, you will come home early, you are not the type of girl who wanders the street!"""
8919,me being the smart arse i am had to reply which earned me another slap and a punch from behind.
8920,"""technically, it is not day, it is night, so your instruction means nothing what so ever, now leave me be!"""
8921,"now, my story lays in the hands of the sequel of my soul, and even though you're dead now harry, here's my message to you, ""harry, i'm scared, i am sorry, but i cannot be brave, when i'm filled with worry, i know your story, but you don't know mine, but i think it's time i told you, i was adopted, i was raped, and abused, my parents hurt me in so many ways, these memories will stay with me to my dying days, harry i miss you, i don't know what to do, i know what your would say to me now, you would say; ""yep, your screwed."""
8922,"i love you harry, you will always be my best friend, no one will ever replace you, you were right, i can be brave, in my own way, by telling this short story of mine, and publishing it for the world to see, i hope your proud of me. xx"
8923,"trees, trees, trees"
8924,"branches, sticks, leaves"
8925,"whipping, gashing, slashing at my arms"
8926,i can't get away no matter how fast i run
8927,"tripping, falling, crawling on the floor"
8928,"ragged cuts, tattered clothes, jagged breathing as i start to slow"
8929,"my eyes are heavy, my vision blurred"
8930,distant images start to stir
8931,"he's right behind me, he's catching up"
8932,i have to keep moving but my legs have had enough
8933,"getting dizzy about to pass out, a distant figure starts to stand out"
8934,"a distant scream, a whispered plea, i can't believe it came from me"
8935,"pulse is racing, a feeling of hands, a gentle hush as i'm helped to stand"
8936,"it's him, he's caught me, please strength don't leave me yet"
8937,let me be anything but his sullied pet
8938,"i have to leave, i have to get away, i fall to my knees and let my head sway"
8939,stopping he stares at me and gives a mirrored laugh
8940,then he reaches for me as i start to move back
8941,"i'm to slow, he's to fast, i can't get away, he's taking me back"
8942,"i can't let this happen, i must react"
8943,"heads to fuzzy, i'm getting to weak"
8944,i'm stumbling over my own feet
8945,"one chance, a pull, a twist, a po+a71p and a moan"
8946,i'm not the one with a broken bone
8947,"i'm still running, he's still coming"
8948,my strength's about to give out
8949,"dead end, cliffs end, water and rocks below"
8950,"tell me, if you had a choice which way would you go?"
8951,i have this illness
8952,that i've suffered from for so long 
8953,and i don't know how
8954,"but i've got to find a way to stay strong, "
8955,i wish i could get over it really quick 
8956,because it's making me go insane 
8957,and it hurts when people pick
8958,it just causes so much pain 
8959,i just wish i could stay strong 
8960,it really bothers me 
8961,because i don't know what's wrong 
8962,i'm telling myself not to cry 
8963,but it's so hard to try 
8964,there's got to be a way for me to stay strong 
8965,as the days go by
8966,i feel worse and worse 
8967,so many things have gone wrong 
8968,and it's just so hard to stay strong
8969,i've got to cry 
8970,so as the tears run down my eyes 
8971,i realized i don't have the strength 
8972,to stay strong
8973,"i'm so tired of all the pain,"
8974,"just please let it rain,"
8975,"so i can hide my tears,"
8976,"so no one can see my fears,"
8977,"that are going to keep haunting, "
8978,"for the rest of my life,"
8979,"just want it all to disappear,"
8980,"so i don't have to deal with my fears,"
8981,"just want it all to go away,"
8982,"i just hope i can be okay, "
8983,"i'm so tired of running,"
8984,"i'm so sick of hiding,"
8985,"all my pain is building up,"
8986,"it all just hurts way too much,"
8987,"i'm so tired of all the pain,"
8988,"just please let it rain,"
8989,"so i can hide all my tears,"
8990,so no one can tell i am full of fear
8991,i'm running out of breath
8992,i can't believe its so hard to breath
8993,my hearts pounding in my chest 
8994,as i wonder if it found me
8995,i hide under the covers and pretend i'm invisible
8996,then i turn around and it is still there
8997,i scream and pray it would just go away
8998,i'm running and running but it is
8999,right behind me 
9000,i've been running from this thing for 5 years now
9001,i stop running and decide to face my fears
9002,once and for all
9003,as i stand face to face to what has caused me
9004,so much misery and pain
9005,i look deeper and deeper into it's eyes
9006,than i realize that it is me
9007,i want you to have it all
9008,"my soul, my mistakes, my heart,"
9009,you have the key to my innermost thoughts
9010,slowly unlocking every door 
9011,"that shades you from me, from what i don't want you to see "
9012,my true colors
9013,"running away from you, from the one who "
9014,"relates, listens ,and appreciate me for who "
9015,"chasing you away from my heart, willing to feel lonely"
9016,just so you wont have a way to hurt me.
9017,constantly chasing you in circles never knowing were it began
9018,and were it will end
9019,"you've unlocked everything, you've seen"
9020,"my fears, my secrets, my joy,"
9021,only one door left as you open it all you see
9022,"is a mirror, my biggest fear"
9023,"facing fear itself, my mistakes"
9024,im sorry for me
9025,"we have been friends for about a year,"
9026,and this is honestly my worst fear.
9027,"i'm scared of our friendship ending,"
9028,"i think it is, and my heart is mending."
9029,"i'm sorry if i did something wrong,"
9030,i'm sorry if i wasn't strong.
9031,"i'm sorry that our friendship didn't work out,"
9032,"but most of all, i'm sorry that i gave you doubt."
9033,"i didn't mean to be mean at all,"
9034,i didn't mean to give you a fall.
9035,"i just wanted our friendship to work out,"
9036,i didn't want you to scream and shout.
9037,"i just fear you're going to be a popular one day,"
9038,"i fear that and if you do, i'm going to have to pay."
9039,"you don't know what it's like to cry yourself to sleep,"
9040,and this whole time i've really been hurting underneath.
9041,"anyway, i just hope you see the sky not cloudy but starry,"
9042,and all i wanted to say was i'm sorry

9318,hiding from those who judge me and those who love me
9319,and laughter helps me do just that

9329,but if that’s all you see
9330,you’re not looking deep enough
9331,look past the tears that i won’t allow to flow
9332,look past the memories that i can’t let go of
9333,"and when you see through all the hate, all the pain and all the hurt"
9334,you'll find me
9335,i cover me up with laughter
9336,there are none who can see the true me
9337,they can’t see through my laughter
9338,and if you should happen to see me
9339,i won’t need laughter to hide anymore
9340,because i can cry on your shoulder
9341,i can smile and enjoy you company without a single sound

9351,about our politician’s famous ‘blame game’! 
9352,"it is then i always hear, loud peals of laughter"
9353,"from our adjacent park, "
9354,"a man dedicated to laughter therapy, "
9355,with his loud guffaw and reverberating bark! 
9356,"trying to resolve this laughing mystery, -"
9357,i read several articles about laughter therapy! 
9358,"amongst all created things and living beings, "
9359,"man alone suffers deeply in his body, mind, "
9360,and soul; 
9361,"with peals of laughter he must suppress his tears, "
9362,to balance this life and control! 
9363,yet during those rare and supreme happy moments
9364,"of life, -"
9365,tears are seen to well-up in our eyes! 
9366,"laughter gets mingled with our tears, -"
9367,i wonder why? ! 
9368,"perhaps laughter and tears are two sides, "
9369,of the same coin of our worldly life! 
9370,"while our lacrymal glands perform this feat, -"
9371,as laughter and tears join hands to make this
9372,life complete! 
9373,"while hearty, non-ridiculing and connecting"
9374,"laughter does provide, "
9375,"physiological, psychological and spiritual"
9376,benefits - on hindsight! 
9377,"laughter brings a twinkle in our eyes, destroying"
9378,our conservative reputation; 
9379,"improving our cardiovascular flexibility, increasing"
9380,our spiritual quotient! 
9381,"laughter like internal jogging, gives us an internal"
9382,performed both silently and rapidly beyond imagining! 
9383,revitalizing those unexplored internal crannies – 
9384,all automatic! 
9385,far better than all our know antibiotics! 
9386,"laughter a tranquilizer without side effects, "
9387,releases our pent-up tension relaxing us instead! 
9388,"an optimist always laughs to forget, while a pessimist"
9389,"forgets to laugh, "
9390,"my man in the park is perhaps an optimist, "
9391,who has embraced this therapy as an art! 
9392,or perhaps that man laughs daily at the frailties of a
9393,"meaningless life, "
9394,in this life of absurdities as he adapts himself to 
9395,this laughter therapy is a tranquilizer both healthy
9396,"and free, "
9397,perhaps that man in the park is laughing at both you
9398,and me! 
9399,our life becomes a tragedy for those who only feel! 
9400,"but a comedy of laughter, if you pause a while to think! "
9401,so let us try to make others laugh while we try to
9402,"control our tears, "
9403,laughing is a healing process and drives away our

9444,then one day he saw a girl
9445,who looked like she was about to hurl
9446,"he sat her down and gave her a crown, then said, ""this will be the one i marry!"""
9447,from that day on
9448,the prince never did frown

9576,"it brings us its blessings of every variety,"
9577,"it softens the blows that lifetime delivers,"
9578,it favors the brave and it crowns achievers.
9579,"it renders us free from oppression by jerks,"
9580,"from mockings, and putdowns, and scoldings,and smirks."
9581,it lets us buy tickets and travel away
9582,from where we're not welcome but are forced to just stay.
9583,"from creditors' letters and big ugly urbs,"
9584,"from all that don't matter, from stuff that disturbs,"

9596,"your looks and your height and your bald, shining pate,"
9597,will wink and remark how handsome you are
9598,"for, in their minds, you are now a star."
9599,"oh, how pathetic society is!"
9600,"a ""miss"" is now where there used to be ""ms."""
9601,"for quickly they learned that you've got all this dough,"
9602,and then they appear from above and below.
9603,"for freedom, for joy and enjoyment of senses,"

9605,just line up your pockets with luscious green money
9606,and soon you'll be hugging a cute playboy bunny.
9607,"as long as you're here on our green earth,"
9608,"and want to be living in freedom and mirth,"
9609,devote your existence to dollar and pound
9610,for cash makes the world go smoothly around.

10649,best friend poem
10650,i still remember the first day we met 
10651,we were too shy to say much at all 
10652,it's funny to think back to that time 
10653,because now we're having a ball! 
10654,they say that true friendship is rare 
10655,an adage that i believe to be true 
10656,genuine friendship is something that i cherish 
10657,i am so lucky to have met you. 
10658,our bond is extremely special 
10659,it is unique in it's own way 
10660,we have something irreplaceable 
10661,i love you more and more each day. 
10662,we've been through so much together 
10663,in so little time we've shared 
10664,i will never forget all the moments 
10665,that you've shown me how much you cared. 
10666,friends are forever 
10667,especially the bond that you and i possess 
10668,i love your fun-filled personality 
10669,somehow you never fail to impress. 
10670,the world could use more people like you 
10671,it would certainly be a better place 
10672,i love everything about you 
10673,you are someone i could never replace. 
10674,you are always there for me 
10675,when my spirits need a little lift 
10676,i cannot thank you enough for that 
10677,you are truly an extraordinary gift. 
10678,you are everything to me and more 
10679,i could never express that enough 
10680,"life is such a treacherous journey, and "
10681,without you it would be even more tough. 
10682,our story will continue to grow 
10683,with each passing day 
10684,because i trust that with you by my side 
10685,everything will always be okay. 
10686,you are so dear to me 
10687,you know i will love you until the end 
10688,"i will always be there for you, and "
10689,you will always (and forever) be my best friend
10690,you've changed my life completely
10691,the day that you were born.
10692,"never knew how wonderful it would be,"
10693,to explore motherhood.
10694,but since i got the chance to
10695,"i have to confess and say,"
10696,that i was so scared to hold you
10697,always thought that you would break
10698,cause you were so tiny an fragile
10699,there was no thinking twice
10700,but as time went on
10701,you got bigger every moment
10702,and the next thing i knew
10703,is you were trying to crawl and walk
10704,there were times when you'd fall and cry
10705,but i would dry them tears
10706,and you would get right back up and try again
10707,just thinking and looking back at the past
10708,i've figured out
10709,that seeing you and those cute little faces you make
10710,is what gets me through each day
10711,i'm so happy your here little sis
10712,i love you very much
10713,and nothing will ever change that.
10714,she lives only in winter
10715,she lives only in winter
10716,even under summer’s sun
10717,she’s re-living every moment
10718,when she thought he was the one
10719,she lives only in winter
10720,getting frozen in this time
10721,steeling the future from her life
10722,and getting punished for her crime
10723,she lives only in winter
10724,away from the springs rain
10725,away from heartbreak summer
10726,and all of autumn’s pain
10727,she lives only in winter
10728,in a world that is unsure
10729,in a world of make-believe
10730,and a world where he loves her
10731,she lives only in winter
10732,cause she cant bare to feel
10733,the truth of her depressing loss
10734,the truth and all that’s real
10735,she lives only in winter
10736,even under summer’s sun
10737,she’s just re-living moments
10738,when she thought he was the one
10739,a special world
10740,a special world for you and me
10741,a special bond one cannot see
10742,it wraps us up in its cocoon
10743,and holds us fiercely in its womb. 
10744,its fingers spread like fine spun gold
10745,gently nestling us to the fold
10746,like silken thread it holds us fast
10747,bonds like this are meant to last.
10748,and though at times a thread may break
10749,a new one forms in its wake
10750,to bind us closer and keep us strong
10751,"in a special world, where we belong."
10752,"my love, i have tried with all my being"
10753,"to grasp a form comparable to thine own,"
10754,but nothing seems worthy; 
10755,i know now why shakespeare could not
10756,compare his love to a summer’s day.
10757,it would be a crime to denounce the beauty
10758,"of such a creature as thee,"
10759,to simply cast away the precision
10760,god had placed in forging you.
10761,each facet of your being
10762,whether it physical or spiritual
10763,is an ensnarement
10764,from which there is no release.
10765,but i do not wish release.
10766,i wish to stay entrapped forever.
10767,with you for all eternity.
10768,"our hearts, always as one."

10774,i think of you each morning
10775,and dream of you each night
10776,i think of your arms being around me
10777,and cannot express my delight

10803,honey did you know??
10804,"i run all the things you say, around in my head"
10805,"it usually brings me peace at night, "
10806,before i go to bed
10807,honey did you know??
10808,that you are in my dreams at night
10809,and honey you look just like an angel
10810,and you send me on a flight
10811,honey did you know
10812,i will always think of you this way
10813,that is why forever
10814,with you my heart will stay
10815,breath of love
10816,"there comes a gentle knocking in this night,"
10817,this night where my slumber lays restless.
10818,i tumble and turn to stir my tears.
10819,my eyes open with the rhythm of
10820,the memories that are tapping at my door. 
10821,you have come again to haunt my dreams
10822,and pull back the covers of my heart.
10823,i lay here willing to think of you and 
10824,the youth you gave me so long ago.
10825,how long the breath of love has lay dormant
10826,"resting and waiting, eager to fill me again."
10827,it has slept with its own aloneness where
10828,my canyons echoed the sounds of its silence.
10829,like a torrent of honey bees your
10830,love comes to me and steels my sleep.
10831,it wakes my soul and shuffles 
10832,the moments of life that live forever. 
10833,your embrace is welcomed like an old friend.
10834,i gladly let it wrap its feelings around me.
10835,the tenderness of your kiss quenches me
10836,until the dawn comes to hide you away.
10837,like the waves from the shore
10838,i must now ebb 
10839,the time has come
10840,to sail my oceans
10841,rolling away from you
10842,like the waves from the shore
10843,rippling out to the vastness of the sea
10844,that beckons my ship of folly
10845,i'll not ask you
10846,to stand the night vigil
10847,on the shoreline
10848,you are here
10849,on the beaches of my memory
10850,even though i drift the tides
10851,if you should look
10852,into a starlit night
10853,and see a reflection of me
10854,know only that
10855,i will one day
10856,come crashing again

11369,"with his questioning, ever-wondering mind?"
11370,"where you were,"
11371,i did not see you.
11372,"so close to me,"
11373,but yet so veiled.
11374,"quietly you waited,"
11375,upon my invitations;
11376,"but still, somehow,"
11377,i failed to note
11378,"of you, yearning"

11380,finally when i knew
11381,"of you, your devotion,"
11382,"so foolishly i did feel,"
11383,like a simpleton.
11384,for i had looked
11385,"so very hard for you,"
11386,but i just did not looked
11387,"clear, in front of me,"

11396,"what if i don't get better,"
11397,that is my biggest fear.

11428,my pains who can express?
11429,"alas, they are so strong;"
11430,my dolour will not suffer strength
11431,my life for to prolong.
11432,"toll on, thou passing bell;"
11433,ring out my doleful knell;
11434,let thy sound my death tell.
11435,death doth draw nigh;
11436,there is no remedy.
11437,alone in prison strong
11438,i wait my destiny.
11439,woe worth this cruel hap that i
11440,should taste this misery!
11441,"toll on, thou passing bell;"
11442,ring out my doleful knell;
11443,let thy sound my death tell.
11444,death doth draw nigh;
11445,there is no remedy.
11446,"farewell, my pleasures past,"
11447,"welcome, my present pain!"
11448,i feel my torments so increase
11449,that life cannot remain.
11450,"cease now, thou passing bell;"
11451,rung is my doleful knell;
11452,for the sound my death doth tell.
11453,death doth draw nigh;
11454,there is no remedy.
11455,the house with nobody in it a poem by joyce kilmer 
11456,whenever i walk to suffern along the erie track
11457,i go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.
11458,"i suppose i've passed it a hundred times, but i always stop for a minute"
11459,"and look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. "
11460,"i never have seen a haunted house, but i hear there are such things;"
11461,"that they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings."
11462,"i know this house isn't haunted, and i wish it were, i do;"
11463,for it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. 
11464,"this house on the road to suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,"
11465,and somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.
11466,"it needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;"
11467,but what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. 
11468,if i had a lot of money and all my debts were paid
11469,i'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.
11470,i'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be
11471,and i'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. 
11472,"now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,"
11473,"looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store."
11474,but there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone
11475,for the lack of something within it that it has never known. 
11476,"but a house that has done what a house should do,"
11477,"a house that has sheltered life,"
11478,"that has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,"
11479,"a house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,"
11480,"is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. "
11481,so whenever i go to suffern along the erie track
11482,"i never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,"
11483,"yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,"
11484,for i can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart
11485,darkness - a poem by lord byron
11486,"i had a dream, which was not all a dream."
11487,"the bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars "
11488,"did wander darkling in the eternal space, "
11489,"rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth "
11490,swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
11491,"morn came, and went and came, and brought no day,"
11492,and men forgot their passions in the dread 
11493,of this desolation; and all hearts 
11494,were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:
11495,"and they did live by watchfires - and the thrones,"
11496,"the palaces of crowned kings, the huts, "
11497,"the habitations of all things which dwell, "
11498,"were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed, "
11499,and men were gathered round their blazing homes 
11500,to look once more into each other's face; 
11501,happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
11502,"of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: "
11503,a fearful hope was all the world contain'd; 
11504,forest were set on fire but hour by hour 
11505,they fell and faded and the crackling trunks 
11506,extinguish'd with a crash and all was black. 
11507,the brows of men by the despairing light 
11508,"wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits "
11509,the flashes fell upon them; some lay down 
11510,and hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
11511,"their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;"
11512,"and others hurried to and fro, and fed "
11513,"their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up "
11514,"with mad disquietude on the dull sky, "
11515,the pall of a past world; and then again 
11516,"with curses cast them down upon the dust, "
11517,"and gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd,"
11518,"and, terrified, did flutter on the ground, "
11519,and flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
11520,came tame and tremolous; and vipers crawl'd 
11521,"and twined themselves among the multitude, "
11522,"hissing, but stingless, they were slain for food:"
11523,"and war, which for a moment was no more, "
11524,did glut himself again; a meal was bought 
11525,"with blood, and each sate sullenly apart "
11526,gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
11527,"all earth was but one thought and that was death,"
11528,immediate and inglorious; and the pang 
11529,of famine fed upon all entrails men 
11530,"died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;"
11531,"the meagre by the meagre were devoured, "
11532,"even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,"
11533,"and he was faithful to a corpse, and kept "
11534,"the birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, "
11535,"till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead "
11536,"lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,"
11537,but with a piteous and perpetual moan 
11538,"and a quick desolate cry, licking the hand "
11539,"which answered not with a caress, he died. "
11540,the crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two 
11541,"of an enormous city did survive, and they were enemies; "
11542,they met beside 
11543,the dying embers of an altar-place
11544,where had been heap'd a mass of holy things 
11545,"for an unholy usage; they raked up, "
11546,and shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands 
11547,"the feeble ashes, and their feeble breath "
11548,"blew for a little life, and made a flame"
11549,wich was a mockery; then they lifted up 
11550,"their eyes as it grew lighter, and "
11551,"each other's aspects. saw, and shriek'd, and died, beheld "
11552,"even of their mutual hideousness they died, "
11553,unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
11554,"famine had written fiend. the world was void,"
11555,"the populous and the powerful was a lump, "
11556,"seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless, "
11557,"a lump of death, a chaos of hard clay. "
11558,"the rivers, lakes, and ocean stood still, "
11559,and nothing stirred within their silent depths; 
11560,"ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, "
11561,and their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropp'd 
11562,they slept on the abyss without a surge 
11563,"the waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,"
11564,the moon their mistress had expired before; 
11565,"the winds were withered in the stagnant air, "
11566,and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need 
11567,of aid from them. she was the universe. 
11568,  
11569,as soft winds sweep away the days
11570,i look back on life through a haze.
11571,"remember playgrounds, parks and friends,"
11572,in childlike gaze that never ends.
11573,"the laughter in a game of catch,"
11574,shall memory ever attach...
11575,"to innocence in youthful eyes,"
11576,catching the ball to dad's surprise.
11577,"i recall my first bike, first wreck,"
11578,"who picked me up, said, ""what the heck?"""
11579,"convinced me to give one more try,"
11580,"while, knees skinned, i forgot to cry."
11581,"just the joy knowing he was there,"
11582,making him proud my only care.
11583,"there was nothing i couldn't do,"
11584,my heart held fast that to be true.
11585,"though teenage years were kind of rough,"
11586,i sure wasn't too big or tough.
11587,you taught me to defend what's right
11588,and never back down from a fight.
11589,"so i learned the hard way to stand,"
11590,"still, with each lump, i found your hand."
11591,"drawing from you an inner strength,"
11592,and stubborn pride of equal length.
11593,"but there the line of fate was drawn,"
11594,as though i blinked and you were gone.
11595,"i found myself facing the sun,"
11596,"not man, not boy, fatherless, one."
11597,"eyes blinded by a void inside,"
11598,i could not live that you had died.
11599,"alas finding it to be true,"
11600,i could do nothing without you.
11601,"please, dad, today just hear my call,"
11602,i'm sorry that i dropped the ball.
11603,"my life is wrecked, my knees are skinned,"
11604,my emotions undisciplined.
11605,"i can't get up although i try,"
11606,please don't be upset if i cry.
11607,"though i can't fight what i can't see,"
11608,"please, dad, say you're still proud of me.  "
11609,dance of terror 
11610,window panes come crashing down
11611,amidst the tears and pain
11612,vanishing hopes are gone and flew away
11613,up above through twilight
11614,shadows cast across the floor
11615,reflections of the past
11616,trembling thoughts of one
11617,dwelling deep within the soul
11618,a mystical sense of reality
11619,captured by the craze
11620,all in bewilderment
11621,of the shock in the wave
11622,creatures of the dimness
11623,chattering amongst the green
11624,everything slows in stillness
11625,what is this we see?

11629,if the choice was mine i'd rather
11630,had not lost either one.
11631,i do not know where i come from
11632,or where i am to go.
11633,"true, this fate is less than some"
11634,and more than some can know.
11635,"my father, my son - you both i miss"
11636,but we shall meet someday
11637,in the kingdom where angels kiss
11638,to chase the clouds away.
11639,i dreamt death came the other night
11640,and heaven's gate swung wide;
11641,with kindly grace an angel came
11642,to usher me inside.
11643,yet there to my astonishment
11644,"stood folks i'd known on earth,"
11645,some i had judged as quite unfit
11646,or of but little worth.
11647,indignant words rose to my lips
11648,but never were set free;
11649,for every face showed stunned surprise
11650,no one expected me! 
11651,this morning’s surprise
11652,this morning’s surprise is how much i’ll miss rail travel.
11653,"the green fields looming up and falling behind,"
11654,"the milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup,"
11655,the engine’s steady vibration.
11656,"this afternoon’s surprise is how many shades of red there are,"
11657,"each one sitting in a room of its own, dense in meditation."
11658,"each one a field of conflict, a medium of conciliation."
11659,this evening’s surprise is not that the novel ends
11660,in a desultory return to the working week -
11661,loose ends trimmed and tucked out of sight -
11662,but the ferocity of my recoil
11663,at the author’s glib contrivance.
11664,midnight’s surprise is lorca’s moon floating over hackney
11665,"full-faced, round-eyed and speaking spanish."
11666,i hate poems
11667,"i try to write a poem,"
11668,but poems are too hard
11669,rhyming is for losers
11670,and airy-fairy bards
11671,to put a pen to paper
11672,and write about your life
11673,"i've had enough of all of those,"
11674,they only cause me strife
11675,"free-verse script is awful,"
11676,for fools without a beat
11677,repetition's far too simple
11678,"just repeat, repeat, repeat"
11679,"those lovey-dovey ode-things,"
11680,that wishy-washy crap
11681,"and poems about hatred,"
11682,you all deserve a slap
11683,"spare me all your ramblings,"
11684,i don't care how you feel
11685,your self-expression surely stinks
11686,of mouldy day-old eel
11687,to tell a tale of wonder
11688,never ceases to be trite
11689,to sing of magic wonders
11690,is nothing but pure ****e
11691,"your metaphors are useless,"
11692,your imagery is vile
11693,"your sense of diction makes me gag,"
11694,"i cannot stand your ""style"""
11695,"so save me your quotations,"
11696,please spare me all your rhyme
11697,shove that poem up your rear
11698,and cease to waste my time
11699,"i look at what i've written,"
11700,this jumble of clichés
11701,looks like i wrote a bloody poem
11702,so i'm the one to blame!
11703,this will be the last time
11704,"i currently drown in a black sea of a swirling abyss,"
11705,as you mould me to how you see fit --
11706,to how you wish me to be.
11707,"you can’t hear it, but i’m screaming on the inside."
11708,"it’s been days, but feels like it’s been years."
11709,i’ve become used to so much torture
11710,that my lace fringed heart stopped breathing.
11711,"now the empty shell of a woman only remains,"
11712,"but you’re pleased with what you’ve done,"
11713,as you marvel at the girl you destroyed.
11714,"now once that coppery sun has set,"
11715,i shall seek my deserving revenge.
11716,with all the hurt and anger i have bottled up
11717,you won’t make it out alive;
11718,you can count on that darling.
11719,the last thing you’ll see will be my charcoal eyes
11720,and the psychotic harlequin smile i don.
11721,be sure that i will rip out your ugly heart with my bare hands;
11722,staining and tarnishing their porcelain finish.
11723,this will be the last i waste my time on you.
11724,"with hugs and love always,"
11725,"sorry, my mask fell, what emotion was i wearing?"
11726,since the day i was born
11727,humanity always hated me
11728,anytime i accomplish something
11729,the critics always slated for free
11730,speaking of this weak flow
11731,and of each illiterate rhyme
11732,"always hearing ""last in show"""
11733,so i retained every word of mine...
11734,"but, look at me now, every rhyme will be sublime"
11735,and this flow of corrupt power runs the show
11736,so now they call it another crime 
11737,to express the feelings i don't know
11738,to write emotions in lifes spare time
11739,and for each new critic who trys to dictate
11740,"another tear sheds, emotions slow"
11741,"defenses shatter, breaking i let go."
11742,wake as essence torn asunder under bright stars
11743,minds obscured in this black i call mine
11744,mental blacklists entwine with physical scars
11745,losing control waiting for god's loving light to shine
11746,"stepping forward, critics rejoice, with headlights and black cars"
11747,                                                                
11748,here is hate-prejudice which thinks
11749,ill of others and there is love-prejudice
11750,which thinks well of others without
11751,"it's your choice, practice hate-prejudice"
11752,or try god's way with love-prejudice.
11753,is it worth the argument?
11754,gone and forgotten
11755, rotting away like time and wear
11756, i become frail like wilting roses
11757, yet they walk on by without a care
11758, and no one even supposes.
11759,  
11760," another page, another turn"
11761, but time after time they are blank
11762, and then my edges start to burn
11763, in place of where my heart sank.
11764,  
11765, i sit alone and decompose
11766, simmer out like a dying light
11767, and despite the poetry and the prose
11768, i slowly loose the fight.
11769,  
11770, now just a pile of cinder and soot
11771, i am swept to a corner to lay
11772, swept by society's heartless foot
11773, with nothing to feel and nothing to say.
11774,  
11775, slowly over time i start to disperse
11776, and blow away in specks of black
11777, and in this lonely pathetic verse
11778, it's too late for you to take it back.
11779,the inevitable end coming sooner than expected
11780,tell me one reason why
11781,i shouldn't do it
11782,jump from this building
11783,or tighten this noose
11784,"swallow these pills,"
11785,"or cut at my wrist,"
11786,why shouldn't i?
11787,life is a ****
11788,"why should i ""deal""?"
11789,or try to get by
11790,when all that i get is for me to cry
11791,"it can be over, ended, and done"
11792,"if i jump, or i can be hung"
11793,my stomach is boiling with the vile of society
11794,the cause for this bile coming out of me
11795,"for my image, does it matter though?"
11796,we all look the same when we meet our fate
11797,i'm closer to the night sky
11798,than to the earth below me
11799,here amongst the peaceful stars
11800,whose dazzling lights enclose me
11801,i've sat upon the crescent moon
11802,spoke of many wishes and dreams 
11803,i've watched the glow of shooting stars
11804,fall down in spiralled streams
11805,i'm sure i saw the spherical shimmer
11806,of other planets far beyond here
11807,i sent subliminal thoughts to them
11808,in the hope that they would answer
11809,i cried tears of loss and happiness
11810,for loved ones who breathe no more
11811,i miss their presence in my life
11812,and the times we shared before
11813,i know that with times passage
11814,hope will slowly flower and grow
11815,i feel its touch within my soul
11816,warming me and making me whole
11817,i've spent many a night flying free
11818,adrift in heavens splendour
11819,i'll stay in this velvet blue haven
11820,"until the sun, my soul awakens"
11821,in his hands
11822,in his hands i feel safe
11823,no harm can come to me
11824,for he holds me to his breast
11825,"and whispers ""i love thee."""
11826,in his hands there is love
11827,this gift he gave to me
11828,it is this gift of love
11829,that set my spirit free.
11830,in his hands there is life
11831,i am not alone
11832,he met me there at heaven's gate
11833,"and softly said ""come home."""
11834,i am sorry mom and dad
11835,for leaving you so soon
11836,even though i'm in his hands
11837,he is there with you.
11838,i feel my mind drifting
11839,drowsy now as dawn draws near.
11840,the shift in season means
11841,"i'll soon be gone, i fear."
11842,i feel my body tire
11843,while my spirit soars on higher.
11844,down my face there rolls
11845,"one lonely, laughing tear."
11846,"and oh, i hope the sun shines bright today."
11847,its shining spectacle will send me on my way.
11848,seems i've seen it all in a dream
11849,i know it's closer than it seems.
11850,for i've lost the urge to hideaway.
11851,there's no need to wander now;
11852,squandered too much anyhow
11853,and failed to find a thing i'd keep.
11854,perhaps true patience lies
11855,in lasting sleep.
11856,"and oh, i pray the sun shines bright today."
11857,its light will speed my flight and guide me to my grave.
11858,"the dream's come clear now, it calls to me,"
11859,"""run through the woods, boy and to the sea."
11860,"only there shall you be saved."""
11861,and blazed upon that forest floor
11862,there is a path i've walked before
11863,which wildly winds
11864,then finally finds the shore.
11865,i'll watch the waves until they crest
11866,then calmly lay these bones to rest.
11867,just another shell upon
11868,the sand forevermore.
11869,"and hey, look how the sun shines bright today!"
11870,poised on the horizon its rays riding every wave.
11871,such a lovely sight to see.
11872,think i'll take it away with me.
11873,to wherever it is i'll be.
11874,christmas 2008 -- a gift
11875,it is christmas soon.
11876,red and green and white
11877,cookies in jars; fruit cakes on trays;
11878,"presents secretively wrapped, betoken"
11879,with beloved names.
11880,christmas carols resound.
11881,joy glitters in eyes. sorrow flares up.
11882,fanfare cannot hide facades. the needy
11883,becomes more needy. melancholic. withdrawn.
11884,"or reach out, cutting the crust of indifference."
11885,"even those forgetting the real present,"
11886,are inevitably embraced by the warmth of love.
11887,at last i found the bread basket liners
11888,"i was looking for: two red cotton squares,"
11889,"the only two in the shop, but part of a set of four, "
11890,of which the other two disappeared.
11891,"no, madam, we may not sell those -- the set"
11892,is incomplete. 
11893,oh! but to me it is complete! i want only these two!
11894,will you please ask the manager if i may buy it?
11895,i asked this with such hope. 
11896,over a distance i saw his friendly smile while the attendant
11897,spoke to him.
11898,"he caught my eye, nodded, and grinned."
11899,"the attendant smiled too, when she reached me:"
11900,madam -- with compliments of the manager:
11901,your christmas present!
11902,"i waved at him, answered his grin, and nodded too. "
11903,joy to the world! our smiling eyes signaled. 
11904,"back at home kitkat, a true christmas cat, looked at me"
11905,"with a clear, knowing gaze:"
11906,it is christmas ... and his love  is in the air.
11907,our greatest gift.
11908,upon hitting the wall. . .
11909,where the still water gathers
11910,the peace of clear skies --
11911,"after the tumbled traipse,"
11912,rock and rill rollick --
11913,mountain face carving in creative
11914,"haste, all the youth of creek"
11915,falling and stumbling ‘cross
11916,"stone and branch in frothy dance,"
11917,this place of solitary glance
11918,‘neath the cool shadows of leaf
11919,near the fern and moss green mist.
11920,when i’ve lost my path amongst
11921,the wonders of love and bedazzled 
11922,by mysteries beyond my grasp --
11923,"my poetic voice, a memory scratched"
11924,"upon papers, bound, to show"
11925,where once my wonder pranced.
11926,emotions caught in lyrical beat.
11927,"i let myself be led to this source,"
11928,this place of infinite relief.
11929,"my aches pulse stilled, frustration shorn"
11930,the inner cacaphony -- want and need --
11931,"my children, clutch and grab at who i be,"
11932,"finally close their eyes, allow the mind to slumber."
11933,the inner ear within the soul becomes alert
11934,waits with surety for the truly  promised gift. 
11935,"the pond, bequeathed, unstirred by ripple or run"
11936,becomes a reflection of the source --
11937,"all gifts, mine since birth, wait for what’s to be heard."
11938,"the small still voice, we all seek,"
11939,"makes clear, without herald of storm, "
11940,awakens the creative seeds to flourish and grow
11941,where i had only seen barren loam. 
11942,"now reborn to the world’s harsh clatter,"
11943,i am healed and whole where once 
11944,"wounded and shattered. my words,"
11945,"dried and dusty, sere, squeezed to no meaning,"
11946,"once again, trumpet joy, are cups "
11947,rich in flavorful meaning to unclench the throat. 
11948,"walled with a cell, caught "
11949,"by my own humanness, tossed and torn"
11950,by competing needs -- i know
11951,i have the strength from the primal spring
11952,that love's me and has my constant thanks.
11953,"join me, upon the banks of this clear"
11954,"quiet pond, listen as you are imbued with serenity,"
11955,for the voice with which miracles blossom.
11956,"whether recognized or not, you will "
11957,be eternally changed and gifted
11958,for the time you have spent upon this spot. 
11959,join me in this simplistic environment.
11960,immerse yourself in the sweet nothingness of this paradise. 
11961,allow the cool breeze to blow past your worry-free mind.
11962,take my hand and embrace this feeling as we close our eyes. 
11963,"like a dream it seems, while we slowly float above."
11964,let’s savor this serene sensation.
11965,we'll bask in the dimming sunlight as the day evolves
11966,and we nurture our current elevation.
11967,hold me while we observe the graceful flight of the souls of the sky 
11968,and we witness the harmonic image of the lively sea spirits.
11969,"let your contentment seize control as we lay here, "
11970,listening to the subtle whistle of the calm wind.
11971,sail away with me in the depths of euphoria. 
11972,let's embark on this beautiful journey and we'll slowly descend.
11973,stay with me while we free-fall into my nirvana.
11974,we'll share the wondrous flavor of bliss
11975,"and feel the touch of pure tranquility,"
11976,rejuvenation is here!
11977,perplexed beyond all solace
11978,you saw in the misted mirror
11979,as a red-eyed teardrop
11980,fell from the drip-pad
11981,of your soft cheek
11982,to land like a pearl
11983,in the palm of your hand
11984,right on your heart line.....
11985,unexpectedly the pearl 
11986,turns to gleaming gold
11987,with all hues of rainbow
11988,before exploding 
11989,without any shock
11990,or any force
11991,to a heavenly place.....
11992,under clear azure sky
11993,without a cloud in sight
11994,wandering through freesia vales
11995,and cyclamen dells
11996,"with pinks, yellows, and purples,"
11997,lilting with rich robin syllables 
11998,and warbley nightingale trills
11999,and edged entirely
12000,by magenta gobuleted magnolias
12001,each chalicing wine
12002,of enchanting to be alive!
12003,above blaze of flame
12004,of sweet wafting azalia blooms
12005,a fabled river 
12006,with droplets like sun dew
12007,every ripple scintillates with hue
12008,that magical mix of pure sunlight
12009,with pure water
12010,that glows with spontaneous fuse
12011,so you take off your shoes
12012,like bathing in champaigne
12013,the water is bubbly and warm
12014,dispersing all worldy worries
12015,making you feel lighter than a feather
12016,and you float peaceful as gossamer
12017,laying on your back
12018,in the spa of the water's form......
12019,elegent damsel flies and butterflies
12020,luster even more wonderful hues
12021,as the kiss of air from their wing-beats
12022,feels almost angelic on your skin!
12023,while waters sun-spangled ripples
12024,scintillatingly and safely
12025,pass completely right through you
12026,"making you feel utterly refreshed,"
12027,"buoyant, pristine, effervesced!"
12028,infused with vibrant health
12029,"returned you to your most zesty, "
12030,as sun-dappled scintillas dance
12031,an entrancing dance
12032,on the trunks of the magnolias
12033,reflected from the streamy ripples
12034,"projecting the lowering sun,"
12035,and as humming-birds 
12036,and shimmering green bees 
12037,head off to roost
12038,you leave the water
12039,to go home yourself....
12040,after pausing under
12041,the saintedly natural cathedral 
12042,of a large green weeping willow
12043,to whisper within it's echo
12044,an appreciative prayer
12045,to the great creator
12046,of all natural bounties
12047,"then....whoosh, you're back at home!"
12048,but you'll remember this place
12049,and come back here again
12050,to be at one with your maker
12051,and all that's lovingly made......
12052,you'll know just when to return
12053,probably reminded by raindrops
12054,or whenever next
12055,you hold a tears pearl
12056,in your hand!
12057,crumbled at the slightest touch.
12058,"roots shriveled, fruit rotted,"
12059,chasms ached with thirst.
12060,seeps into my soil;
12061,"breaches heal, roots swell--"
12062,i burst into bloom.
12063,"wind whispers forgiveness,"
12064,limbs shiver with joy.
12065,your colors kiss my soul--
12066,we breathe a bow of peace.
12067,peace the world together
12068,"the world’s heartstrings, should strum in harmony,"
12069,where oxygen longs only wars to cease.
12070,"blessed are benign souls who bestow beauty,"
12071,"as mindful poets, weave love's masterpiece."
12072,"such sweet quintessence, like stars in a row,"
12073,"where some stand, hand in hand, out of the blue."
12074,"let's unleash peace, a path we need follow,"
12075,"revealing rapport, our worlds never knew."
12076,"like starry lightshows, of lucid night skies,"
12077,"sparkling in unison, where silk songs play."
12078,"diplomatic minds, be still and think wise,"
12079,"let’s learn from history, starting today."
12080,"dreaming of all life, where we can share rain,"
12081,"where souls can feel warmth, healing in love's light."
12082,"embrace peace, after long eras of pain,"
12083,so new generations won’t fear the night.
12084,"may friendly smiles fill souls with gentleness,"
12085,"living anew, this peace our lips profess."
12086,spill your peace
12087,through vale of
12088,"fear, where raging"
12089,storms threaten to tear
12090,down fence of safe haven.
12091,spill your peace upon barren
12092,deserts torched by horror of war
12093,"lighten our hearts heavy with regret,"
12094,gather restless in your gracious embrace.
12095,the real victory!
12096,"kings, presidents and chiefs "
12097,rule the world with the people’s fear;
12098,"making law at their side, so they’ll keep "
12099,ruling the world from their comfy seats.  
12100,"mastering the language of wars and hostilities,"
12101,"nothing to lose, just send armies to the battlefield!"
12102,"freedom, justice and independence,"
12103,these concepts in politics are just theories  
12104,"oh peace, will you ever be here? "
12105,"i’ve never seen you in this sphere,"
12106,i’ve just read about you in the myths.
12107,"but i know that one day, you’ll be real."
12108,"they’ll see people screaming ‘’ cheers ‘’,"
12109,as to celebrate the victory they have achieved .
12110,"now all i got to do is write this rhyme ,"
12111,and wait for someone to understand what it means.
12112,"wait for people not to be sheep,"
12113,and for societies to wake up from their sleep;
12114,so as to push hierarchies down to the deep.
12115,that’s how our kids will know the truth peace.
12116,where there is love
12117,where there is love there is life
12118,regardless of strife
12119,where there's desire there's a way 
12120,where there is sun a hopes ray
12121,peace is present each day 
12122,where there is hope there is light 
12123,"warmth lifts, renewed height "
12124,when we open our closed heart 
12125,when we search for a fresh start 
12126,peace will find a way

12133,when his heart opened to give 
12134,when we may love him and live 
12135,in peace i pray
12136,there is a magical peace in watching you sleep
12137,that’s not unlike the calm surrender
12138,of quietly observing a meandering river
12139,as it slowly wends its way down its muddy banks
12140,past reeds and grasses on the marshy shore
12141,to somewhere new and heretofore unknown
12142,"the current, steady as your unconscious breath"
12143,moves through the cycles of your mind
12144,bringing you respite from the troubling stream of consciousness
12145,and pulling you down to a course of dreams
12146,where i like to think of you
12147,like that warm brown river
12148,flowing gently into me
12149,"you lie so quiet, still"
12150,your breath bidding me closer
12151,like the river beckons the thirsty to drink
12152,would that i could drink you down
12153,so you really did flow through me
12154,and bestow on me your peace
12155,"surprise surprise surprise"""
12156,"my honey's a ""gem"" and he pampers me"
12157,and promised his love eternally.
12158,was coming our way--
12159,what beautiful gift would i see?
12160,the day broke clear that early morn.
12161,i expected a package with bow adorned.
12162,"but, woe is me!"
12163,no gift did i see!~
12164,i was feeling so sad and forlorn!
12165,"my honey had a ""smirk"" on his face"
12166,as he took me into his embrace.
12167,"he said, ""close your eyes--"
12168,"there's a big surprise!"""
12169,"i balled up my fist, just in case!"
12170,"blindly, i was led to the lawn"
12171,"while i kept asking, ""what's going on?"""
12172,"he said, ""wait and see--"
12173,i'm sure you'll agree--
12174,"all your worries will soon, be gone!"""
12175,"alas, i became so excited"
12176,and my inner-fires ignited!
12177,i felt so elated 
12178,that i would be so delighted.
12179,"slowly, i opened my eyes"
12180,and much to my surprise--
12181,what did i see
12182,in front of me ??
12183,"a ""clothesline"" with all it implies!"
12184,"now, the laughter filled the air!"
12185,i didn't show signs of despair.
12186,i took control
12187,and embraced the pole--
12188,"he'll soon, have ""starch"" in his underwear!"
12189,surprise surprise pretty surprise
12190,"oh boy, a brand new slate"
12191,"you're all in for a huge surprise, just wait"
12192,you thought i had money before?
12193,now i'll be sweating money from my pores
12194,this is just in time
12195,seriously i'm on cloud nine!
12196,"surprise, surprise surprise"
12197,"never know whats in store for me for today,"
12198,"doctors or patients,"
12199,"ear pain, back pain or stuffed throat?"
12200,"when you started talking to me again yesterday,"
12201,it took me by complete surprise.
12202,"i didn't know what to say really, i was in total shock."
12203,i still am even after reading the whole conversation again. 
12204,"you seem to have had a change of heart, but i'm not sure why."
12205,"i'm glad that you did though, because i missed talking to you."
12206,"maybe you realized that i had no part of it,"
12207,that it was all just a misunderstanding.
12208,"i still can't believe that you wanted to see me before you left,"
12209,after telling me not to talk to you any more.
12210,"then to see the words ""you can call me some if you want."","
12211,has just really blew my mind!
12212,"i'm still not sure what to think of it all,"
12213,i guess you can say that i am kind of confused.
12214,"all of a sudden here you are saying you want to chill with me,"
12215,after telling me that you had changed your mind about anything else.
12216,"you acted just as interested as you did before,"
12217,"so i can't help but ask, what's up?"
12218,"have you changed your mind, had a change of heart?"
12219,"i sure hope you have, i had high hopes of it being more."
12220,"so i don't know where this will lead,"
12221,"i have to wait a while to see because you have already left,"
12222,but i guess only time will tell!
12223,"it is really up to you though, my friend."
12224,i called you once and you didn't respond
12225,even though you specifically said to call you sometime.
12226,"okay, that's alright, maybe you were busy"
12227,"or didn't hear it.  either way, maybe i should try again later."
12228,"again, nothing.  alright, i'll leave a message,"
12229,even though i hate having to talk to a machine.
12230,i'll call sometime tomorrow.
12231,"once again nothing, maybe you're ignoring me,"
12232,maybe i was wrong to hope
12233,that you and me...
12234,"okay one more time, yes you answered!"
12235,you'll be coming down later?
12236,"awesome, great!  i'll be waiting."
12237,and waiting.  and waiting.
12238,i'll go watch tv.
12239,"what? you were here?  when?  you just left, no no!"
12240,"okay, i'll try again.  no answer..."
12241,"the next day, no answer..."
12242,"one more time, nothing... maybe she doesn't like me"
12243,after all.  curse that god damned hope.  it got me again.
12244,"one moment can tell a story for years, "
12245,passed down with twists and turns... 
12246,"but no matter how many distortions are made, "
12247,it is the original that is truly yours. 
12248,"'twas the first day of school, "
12249,"such an interesting day, "
12250,i walked the halls nervously
12251,a lack of words to say. 
12252,"turning a corner, "
12253,i look up and around:
12254,"a teacher asks a boy for his name, "
12255,i myself shocked by the sound:
12256,the name has been spoken 
12257,and time seems to stop; 
12258,i look up at the boy in confusion
12259,and feel my jaw drop. 
12260,no way! is it really him?
12261,you? he? that guy?
12262,the one i thought lost
12263,"now returned, how? why? "
12264,was he not gone for such a period
12265,that i'd thought his return unseen:
12266,now this even is so abrupt! 
12267,it happened so quickly...
12268,we're best friends
12269,you & i
12270,but i love you
12271,and your brown eyes
12272,just a boy and a girl
12273,never torn apart
12274,afraid to date
12275,afraid to start
12276,never felt like this
12277,never opened up my heart
12278,till just lately
12279,now i know wasn't smart
12280,you told me before
12281,we'll be together soon
12282,but today you changed your mind
12283,now everything seems ruined
12284,i don't know what to say
12285,my face a blank stare
12286,tears flowing out my eyes 
12287,life really isn't fair
12288,you say you can't lose me
12289,and you didn't want to hurt me
12290,but there was no way around it
12291,now i ask you to let me be
12292,i need time to let you go
12293,i need space so i can think
12294,i'll never open up my heart again
12295,for it to only sink
12296,your still my best friend
12297,i'll always wish we were more
12298,but i respect your wish
12299,tho my feelings were tore.
12300,an 'elegy' for irony
12301,by glen martin fitch
12302,how we loved to watch you tie
12303,our muddled minds
12304,into a knotted maze.
12305,your jests and jokes
12306,"did twist each question,"
12307,till heart and head
12308,were drugged in deadly daze.
12309,never have you had such praise
12310,"for tense distortion,"
12311,farce and helplessness.
12312,"with hope abandoned,"
12313,darkest night betrays
12314,and only death to bless.
12315,"and yet in spite of lethe,"
12316,i must confess my heart still beats
12317,"and wiser have i grown,"
12318,"while i have no spirit left to guess,"
12319,i know the constants
12320,even you have known.
12321,and so if queer queens love
12322,and scapegoats die
12323,won't spring reveal the truth
12324,of every “lie”?

12326,"by aquamarine waters of my kingdom,"
12327,"surrounded with splendor of treasures of my creations,"
12328,"in a hard shell of a crab, i was sitting and contemplating on my life’s journey,"
12329,"one day, as the golden rays of the sun touched the earth,"
12330,"the silky threads of my cocoon passed through my heart,"
12331,"thus illuminating my spirit, warming my body and soul."
12332,"and as the night sky touched the earth,"
12333,"by the silver rays of the moon i was transformed into a butterfly,"
12334,keeping the color of my kingdom of aquamarine colors
12335,i spread my wings as far as i could;
12336,two golden threads connected me to heaven from earth leading my path.
12337,"and as i was transformed into a butterfly and given the wings to fly,"
12338,"and fly i did, as far as i could see."
12339,"on my paths i discovered many places and many souls,"
12340,"some went along with me, some stayed behind to discover their own paths."
12341,"my journey is not over yet, it seems that it has just began, once more,"
12342,"and this time around i plan to fly even further,"
12343,"spreading my wings far and wide, travel to different lands,"
12344,"sharing the splendor of my creations and gifts with the whole world,"
12345,"meeting the souls that are transformed into butterflies as well,"
12346,"this way we may all spread our sparkles of love and light,"
12347,"illuminating the paths for the rest that plan to follow us,"
12348,on our souls’ path of the life’s journeys with love and light in our hearts.
12349,"so you too, if you been transformed into a butterfly as well,"
12350,"come and join us on our flight to freedom through love,"
12351,because this way we can all create beautiful heaven on earth
12352,and in our hearts were it all began.
12353,believe your heart
12354,by sweta leena panda
12355,sometimes people says don’t make wrong choice
12356,you will be forever alone
12357,however i believe no choice make me alone
12358,until & unless i want
12359,no doubt my tears are dry now
12360,& it’s now like river without water
12361,still my eyes are live
12362,who says many things?
12363,no doubt i hide it like the hidden treasure
12364,no one can open it
12365,because i lost the key of my treasure knowingly
12366,i believe if a person understands it without saying
12367, he/she truly loves
12368,"tear may fake, however eyes are true always "
12369,sometimes words may fake
12370,however heart is true always
12371,never judge a person by their words
12372,judge them by their heart
12373,because heart is a like an open precious treasure
12374,where you find many things which you never know
12375,"try to steal it, as it is very precious"
12376,always believe the words of your heart
12377,because it will never ever cheat you
12378,it always tells love & care for everyone
12379,however never ever take the words of everyone granted
12380,sometimes when we really need help
12381,these people become good spectator & listeners
12382,start saying about you
12383,without knowing  the story of you
12384,no person is copy of another
12385,so how people commenting others
12386,stop discuss about others
12387,"if you can’t help others,"
12388,at least don’t pull their legs down

12390,if i knew that those sunday-school stories i heard would become
12391,"a ball of uncertainty rolling around inside me,"
12392,"if my parents hadn’t kicked me out for dating the youth pastor wannabe,"
12393,and i hadn’t moved in with the married lesbian.
12394,if the married lesbian hadn’t decided to divorce her husband
12395,"i wouldn’t have ended up living in athens, georgia where"
12396,"i would, in the span of a week discover that my boyfriend was"
12397,"cheating on me, miscarry our baby, and get mugged."
12398,if i hadn’t moved in with my ex-boyfriend’s mother after that
12399,"and then in with a distant cousin in milledgeville, georgia"
12400,where i would find my perceptions altered by practicing the loss
12401,"of time through smoke and mushrooms, multiple partners"
12402,and practicing being good enough* at karaoke. or if my drinking buddy
12403,hadn’t said that the guy running the karaoke night
12404,"was gay, so that i challenged — i would bet her a beer that i could"
12405,"get him in the sack, and if he hadn’t asked for my"
12406,number that same night only to tear it up a week later because i turned him
12407,down because i was still only seventeen and wouldn’t be
12408,let into the bar where he wanted to take me dancing. and if the drummer
12409,in the band i sang for hadn’t done twelve shots of white
12410,lightning the following new year’s and then urinated on me in bed because
12411,"he was in diabetic shock, and if i hadn’t covered the shift"
12412,"delivering pizzas for the girl i worked with, and if i hadn’t gone"
12413,"to the party, where the guy that ran karaoke"
12414,"read poetry, and i sang bad imitations of janis joplin—"
12415,"then i wouldn’t have ended up in place of eight month snows,"
12416,"married ten years to the guy that ran karaoke, and i wouldn’t be watching our"
12417,"two children recreating games of hopeful daisy chains, and"
12418,animal clouds. and if we had chosen any other branch?

12421,from: any other branch
12422,some call i m crazy
12423,some say i m sick
12424,i think it’s freedom
12425,"however ,it helps release the pain"
12426,that i go through every day
12427,feeling like everything's wrong
12428,i want to escape from my sadness
12429,however now i m looking forward
12430,i no longer feel like a coward
12431,any challenge put before me to stand and face it
12432,any blessing waiting for me to try and take it
12433,although almost brought tears
12434,however i promise i’ll never cry

12440,we don’t think they matter but they do
12441,everything that happens has a reason
12442,the truth will be revealed in due season
12443,our life is a journey that we must make
12444,"a road, a path, which we must take"
12445,our course is never easy
12446,the stakes may be high
12447,we should not let our life like the leaves in winter
12448,life is a poem where we write our story everyday
12449,life is a game which we must play
12450,through trouble and disaster
12451,we never know what we will get
12452,our hand is not always get what we want
12453,we always learn a lesson of hearts and minds is taught
12454,however from the failure
12455,we should not walks on a street of hopeless & blind
12456,sometimes we find the face with in the face
12457,which hurt us most of the time?
12458,still we always expected to act like the world is as beautiful and clean
12459,if we struggle let it be
12460,with hope for things we wish to see
12461,"so in every day let’s find you, knowing the world for its reality …+a184"
12462,"let go, a truth so bitter;"
12463,"let go, a wound so sore"
12464,for nothing in life is permanent;
12465,and 'change' is the only constant !
12466,"let go, a hidden drop of tear;"
12467,"let go, a secret concealed & obscured"
12468,for a day that follows the night without remorse;
12469,from a grappling 'dusk' to a delighting 'dawn' !
12470,"let go, the mask that covers your identity;"
12471,"let go, the shield that safeguards your dignity"
12472,"'coz, you are the betrayer, the only traitor;"
12473,who can deceive others but the real 'you' !
12474,"let go, the profound pain that agonizes you;"
12475,"let go, the sinful urge that torments you"
12476,for 'time' alone is the best healer;
12477,like a 'boon' to mankind in disguise !
12478,"let go, the evil neighboring you;"
12479,"let go, the devil inside of you."
12480,your overblown 'ego' & overstated 'attitude'
12481,limitless idiosyncrasy & eccentricities!
12482,"let go, your fear, hurt & resentment;"
12483,"let go, broken promises & hollow commitments."
12484,for life is too petite to brood over 'insignificant issues'
12485,like grains of sand; waiting to be eroded with ceaseless time !!!!
12486,"let us pull, pull the boat+a186"
12487,"let us pull, pull the boat,"
12488,away from the waters
12489,safe on to land
12490,just the while perhaps till the morning
12491,"and pull, young one…take a deep breath and pull…"
12492,generations have worked and gone past exertion
12493,and into a discovery of inner strength
12494,and a sudden illumination perhaps
12495,of the resilience within…
12496,"feel and pull - see, there’s the boat and you"
12497,and the forces and the ground
12498,and there’s much within you…
12499,there’s the mark of the effort
12500,in your mind as footprints in the sand
12501,"pull, young one…safe to land – a little more"
12502,and a little more…
12503,"and we are come to completion, and you will see"
12504,"where the struggle, where the living"
12505,and all these days of our lives between earth
12506,and the oceans begin and end…
12507,"a chest of metal, an eagle’s vision"
12508,"a teeth of sour girdle, an insight of taught mentions"
12509,"a plunging foot, a never dragging heart"
12510,"there a princess stood, but never a hint of look or any dart"
12511,scorching suns were braved
12512,torenting skies were naived
12513,dust like a life stuck up in every breadth
12514,but the bronze turned skin shows his worth of every mile
12515,"a sweet child’s look, an outsmarting tangle"
12516,a heart wrapped up in pure satin
12517,"to be lent, to without crave given... to the"
12518,bronze man in the shining armour
12519,"a metal built but without any doubt, human emotions he felt"
12520,"a mask of ignorance worn,"
12521,a mask of love that was thrown
12522,"days of blooming flowers, ages of moving clouds"
12523,a touch of line upon the princess’ radiant skin shone
12524,"a wage of a tower, but yet never held any power..."
12525,his people mattered most he splattered
12526,"wars of brave ones gone, yet he seemed as strong as sun"
12527,but just as unique and lovely he was
12528,"a gray tress came along, but never did the princess"
12529,show a sign of crave w+a185ithdrawn
12530,she gazed and withheld the a184heart that was never given to hold
12531,neigh a quarter century but seventeen years of doom stay
12532,"who says, every living moment was a precious day"
12533,"until a battle came, the same messenger to call them away"
12534,"the torrent warnings and swords flocked,"
12535,"the persons in numbers, they were all brave soldiers that flocked"
12536,a life’s battle…so long will take
12537,maybe a fortnight or until the next full moon day
12538,her heart leapt just like it had for every rage in these seventeen years
12539,she crouched; she leaned to have the clearest view
12540,of her bronze man in the shining armour
12541,"he was at his point’s sharpness, a heart of rage and a love for his men unmeasured"
12542,a triumphant eagle’s scowl thrown
12543,a way to the highest he has never known
12544,"but a look of gracious melodies, everlasting charms made a flash"
12545,"he turned to the tower, where he knew the princess stood and gave a look into her eyes and then to the skies as he always did"
12546,a pleasure of pre-victory to have earned the world’s most precious gem
12547,but a look of plain bravery and everlasting plight
12548,but less did he know this would be his last sight
12549,with a brave leap onto his trustee
12550,he rode off... into the land of wilderness
12551,into the air of plain aura
12552,thus she held... thus she will tell...
12553,that this is my knight’s shining armour
12554,"i may never see tomorrow,"
12555,"there's no written guarantee,"
12556,"i don't seem to understand,"
12557,"however i know who hold tomorrow,"
12558,"the great power, which shows me light every time"
12559,"i walk besides him, for he knows what is ahead,"
12560,"things that happened yesterday belong to history,"
12561,"i cannot predict my future,"
12562,"i cannot change my past,"
12563,"i have just the present moment,"
12564,"i must treat it as my last,"
12565,"i must use this moment wisely for it soon will pass away,"
12566,every step is getting brighter as the golden stairs i climb.
12567,"every stars getting lighter,"
12568,"there the sun is always shining over my head,"
12569,"so there no fear for dark,"
12570,"i feel like touching the rainbow after a heavy rain,"
12571,"still i don't know about tomorrow,"
12572,"it may bring poverty,"
12573,"however i have faith upon someone,"
12574,"the one who stands by me,"
12575,"path i follow & his presence always helps me to look forward,"
12576,"so i thanks god with humble heart for giving me this day,"
12577,his great blessing over my head...
12578,a dream girl
12579,before i have too much expectations for a girl.
12580,she must be smoking hot and very beautiful.
12581,"she must be conservative, educated and rich"
12582,"but i now realize, you can't  have a perfect match."
12583,i was looking around the city
12584,"patiently waiting for a real love to say,"
12585,"""come, my baby. marry me."""
12586,"but i now realize, you can't buy or borrow love."
12587,i was a fool when i didn't notice a simple girl
12588,who made me happy every single day.
12589,she took away my loneliness and put a big drill
12590,into my closed and selfish heart.
12591,a big idea?
12592,by satish verma
12593,the moral dilemma was 
12594,less than truth. 
12595,downgrading the- 
12596,branded witch. 
12597,vaccine was spawning new virus. 
12598,"o buddha, why did you "
12599,started looking beautiful 
12600,and began sitting in a living room? 
12601,trailing the smoke 
12602,i was going to find the- 
12603,burning home. 
12604,what were those intimate- 
12605,words of unthinkable 
12606,by anselm vaz
12607,"i found a rose, not red to see."
12608,its pettles with blisters crumpled down.
12609,it looked at me with a dead smile.
12610,uttering drops of tears and silent shivers.
12611,"no speach to define, the pain and plunder."
12612,thinking of the past ectasy.
12613,taking sometime to survive.
12614,"in the dark sunshine,"
12615,with no glittering light to see.
12616,"oh! how was it picked by the lover winds,"
12617,and stamped by foreseen legs.
12618,"the wounds so deep, can't be healed."
12619,"the plunder pain, can't let it sleep."
12620,"a magical prayer, i say to god."
12621,to heal this flower and take it away from me.
12622,so no pain would touch its hearts.
12623,"and only smiles would make its way,"
12624,"to heavens gates,"
12625,"and the hells flames,"
12626,would be waiting for me.

12660,you said you'd always be there
12661,but you're nowhere to be found
12662,i can't believe you left me
12663,i feel so low beneath the ground
12664,there's nothing i can do now
12665,i trusted you with all my heart
12666,but now you're gone
12667,you're the one who tore my life apart
12668,i've learned not to trust
12669,there's nothing more to say
12670,you've lost someone special
12671,you can't get back each day
12672,now you're the one left in the dark
12673,and all of a sudden you feel my pain
12674,you expect me to take you back
12675,but you still feel you're not to blame
12676,i could never forgive you
12677,even if i tried
12678,you can never make up
12679,for the lonely nights i've cried
12680,you will never know the feeling
12681,of losing the person you need the most
12682,to laugh and cry and love you
12683,instead of making you feel like a ghost
12684,i've moved on with my life
12685,without you by my side
12686,my pain has kept so long
12687,i'm telling you how i feel inside
12688,in a way i want to thank you
12689,because of you i'm strong
12690,i just wanted you to know
12691,i didn't turn out wrong
12692,always my father but never my dad
12693,"i'm sorry you missed out when i went to school for the 1st time,"
12694,"and you didn't have me tell you that you were all mine,"
12695,"i'm sorry you weren't there to take me to the mall,"
12696,"and you weren't there to tell me i have to stand tall,"
12697,sorry you weren't the one i saw when i came home that day 
12698,"or the one i'd run to when i had a bad day,"
12699,"i'm sorry you didn't hear me write these, you'd have been so proud, "
12700,"and you weren't there to lift me up on a cloud,"
12701,"sorry you weren't there to tell me there's nothing to fear,"
12702,"but then again you should have been here,"
12703,"i'm sorry you weren't the one to teach me to ride a bike,"
12704,or the one who took me on my first ride.
12705,"i'm sorry you weren't the one who carried me on his back,"
12706,"that was my other daddy, the one i actually had!"
12707,"or the one who held me tight when strength is what i lacked,"
12708,"i'm sorry you weren't the one to hold me when i cried,"
12709,"or tell me i did great when i really tried,"
12710,"i'm sorry you were never there to teach me how to cook,"
12711,"or there at night to read me my favorite book,"
12712,"i'm sorry me as a daughter is what you never had,"
12713,"you will always be my father, but you will never be my dad."
12714,"standing in self-hatred,"
12715,drowning in my tears.
12716,"looking back on my life,"
12717,what i've been through the past 18 years.
12718,"living in my brother's shadow,"
12719,"everything i do & say,"
12720,"wishing somehow things would change,"
12721,praying for a way.
12722,"same old sh*t just another day,"
12723,living this evil life that was created just for me.
12724,"starving for love, affection, & attention,"
12725,i know none of this is how it's really supposed to be.
12726,"i try to be strong,"
12727,even though i feel so weak.
12728,"feel like just giving up,"
12729,but i won't accept that level of defeat.
12730,"pretend like i'm always happy,"
12731,although i'm never really okay.
12732,"waiting for this pain to end,"
12733,that i feel every stupid day.
12734,"it's hard to say what's wrong,"
12735,when nothings going right.
12736,"hard to keep myself going,"
12737,when i've been blinded by sight.
12738,"this pain is never ending,"
12739,it just goes on & on & on.
12740,"it's all so unbelievably real,"
12741,i just wish it all was gone.
12742,"trying to pick myself up,"
12743,when i've fallen so far and hard.
12744,"but i don't know where i'm going,"
12745,it's all so very dark.
12746,"my heart is weak, my emotions sore,"
12747,i do my best to never let it show.
12748,"but deep down inside i feel like,"
12749,i'm dying & nobody knows.
12750,"a lot of f***ed up thoughts,"
12751,run through my head constantly.
12752,"i just wish i didn't live,"
12753,this life of misery!
12754,how do you call yourself a mom?
12755,looking in yours eyes
12756,tells me something's wrong
12757,never began to realize
12758,you've neglected for so long.
12759,it seems your never there
12760,you never really try
12761,and every time i want to be with you
12762,you make up stupid lies.
12763,i feel as if 
12764,i'm just your friend
12765,that you hate being around
12766,so don't pretend
12767,don't say you love me
12768,with that dreadful tone
12769,it doesn't make sense
12770,why you never answer your phone
12771,it's pathetic to know
12772,you had three daughters
12773,but you have nothing to do with any of them
12774,that truly makes me wonder
12775,sure our family has had problems
12776,but not that bad that u can ignore
12777,so if you expect me to stick around
12778,i'll walk right out of the door
12779,you wonder why i live with dad
12780,at least he does try
12781,daddy has always cared about me
12782,do you know how much this makes me cry
12783,i feel like your dead
12784,because your never there
12785,your dead to me 
12786,how is that fair
12787,i have never done anything to hurt you
12788,and your boyfriend comes before your me?
12789,that's bull shit mom
12790,pay attention to me
12791,its always poor poor pitiful you
12792,you always have problems
12793,you tell me your troubles
12794,like i'm supposed to stop them?
12795,you used to call every day
12796,just to see how i was doing
12797,now it's like you don't own a phone
12798,as my emotions are brewing
12799,it's so hard not to cry
12800,knowing my mother is barely around
12801,i see girls so close the there mothers
12802,but it's as if mine is already in the ground
12803,do you ever cry over me mom?
12804,do you ever stop and wonder?
12805,about how i am doing
12806,your just a silent thunder
12807,i hate loving you
12808,there's no point if it's not returned
12809,my sisters hate it too
12810,i feel like my skin is in a blazing fire being burned
12811,trying to smile
12812,when i'm with you never seems to faze me
12813,"you were always the ""cool mom"""
12814,but now you don't care about me.
12815,so now when you need me
12816,i hope you know i won't be here
12817,i hope one day you read this
12818,and it brings a world of fear
12819,i don't want your hugs
12820,and fake understanding
12821,i want a mom
12822,who is never-ending
12823,i'm sorry mom
12824,but i gotta say
12825,i'll always love you
12826,but never look my way!
12827,daddy told me.....
12828,i was told i was living a lie
12829,i was told don't bother to cry
12830,i was told they no longer did care
12831,"i was told i love you, they did not dare"
12832,i was told i am a bad role model for my sister and brother
12833,i was told i was betrayed by my mother
12834,i was told my mother did not love me
12835,i was told that is why she chose to flee
12836,"i was told, the love i have for my mother to hide"
12837,i was told i later picked the wrong side
12838,i was told the abuse i got was 'tough love'
12839,i was told that while getting a shove
12840,i was told i brought them to shame
12841,i was told i were many horrible names
12842,i was told i was not the daughter they had in mind
12843,i was told the love for me they could not find
12844,i was told i was expected to fall
12845,i was told they would not help when they received that call
12846,i was told i was going no where
12847,i was told to stay far from there
12848,i was told i would not make much of my life
12849,i was told she'd be the one to cut with a knife
12850,i was told they would leave me alone
12851,i was told i was a daughter disowned
12852,daddy no longer wants his little girl'
12853,i needed you
12854,"when i was sad and depressed,"
12855,i needed you to be cheer me up.
12856,instead i drank till i was numb enough not to feel anything.
12857,"when everyone was attacking me and putting me down, making me feel so low,"
12858,i needed you to be the one to defend me and be on my side
12859,instead i endured all the cruel words and criticism the world threw at me.
12860,"when i lost all my friends and had no one,"
12861,"i needed you to be that only friend i had left, "
12862,"instead i experience what the word ""friendless"" really meant."
12863,"when i was scared and frightened,"
12864,i needed you to be my security blanket.
12865,instead i had to live in fear.
12866,"when i was angry and full of rage,"
12867,"i needed you to calm me down,"
12868,instead i kept it all bottled up inside.
12869,"when i felt so lonely and needed someone to care,"
12870,i needed you to hold me tight and never let me go.
12871,instead i grew up alone with no one to turn to.
12872,"when i was hurt and in pain,"
12873,i needed you to come running with you healing ways.
12874,instead i remained scarred and bruised.
12875,"when i would inflict self-torture, wanting to die,"
12876,i needed you to stop me and tell me how important i was.
12877,instead i hid my scars and became oblivious to everyone.
12878,"when i would cry myself to sleep at night,"
12879,i needed you to wipe the tears away.
12880,instead i held my pillow tight while never ending tears streamed down my face.
12881,"when my world was crashing down on me,"
12882,i needed you to be the one i ran to.
12883,instead i locked myself in my room in complete despair.
12884,"when i felt unloved,"
12885,i needed you to tell me how much you loved me.
12886,"instead i learned the words ""i love you"" are meaningless."
12887,"leaving behind others to take your place,"
12888,"carrying on your name, walking around with your face,"
12889,"knowing you go left behind,"
12890,wondering what's on my fathers mind.
12891,he didn't even think to try.
12892,"to leave my mother with tears going down her face,"
12893,"left me only to embrace,"
12894,only for me to ask her why?
12895,my mother can give me answers;
12896,my father left behind.
12897,"for he can give his love to another,"
12898,"but can't give his love to me,"
12899,"my mother would give her life,"
12900,"as she's given life to me,"
12901,my father i hope to love.
12902,will he ever really love me?
12903,"he can take and make a life and keep living on,"
12904,"but what is it like to live without a father,"
12905,"he doesn't even know,"
12906,"because he doesn't even care,"
12907,he left me alone.
12908,set her free
12909,why do you do this to her? 
12910,why do you make her cry and hide her fears so deep inside? 
12911,is she not beautiful enough or does she not have enough wit or charm? 
12912,why is that you make her feel like a dog that you have chained to the tree and trained to answer only at you’re beck and call? 
12913,"misery and pain is what you have taught her to believe in, "
12914,will she ever get the courage to run and get away? 
12915,to me you are the devil in disguise 
12916,constantly standing over her watching from the corner of you’re eye. 
12917,do you think you’re perfect? 
12918,do you think that we should just sit back and watch her become more miserable every passing day 
12919,because you have taught her to believe that without you she can’t get by? 
12920,you credent you rodent you evil man in my eyes 
12921,i see the truth and from me that you can not hide!!!! 
12922,"some may sit back and watch you make her die inside, "
12923,but as for me i will bring back that sparkle i have seen in her eyes.
12924,i will not cover for you i will not lie. 
12925,i will not sit back and let you’re wickedness slowly kill who she really is so deep inside. 
12926,courage and bravery is what i will make arise from my beautiful aunt. 
12927,"you try to keep for yourself to hide you’re own pity and worthlessness, "
12928,"you are no better, you are no good, "
12929,wake up and face the truth 
12930,without her you are nothing but a menace to society 
12931,a fake a fraud and a pitiful excuse for anyone to call a husband 
12932,but even more you’re not even worth having the title of being called a man. 
12933,"let her go, let her live, let her be set free. "
12934,hide in you’re corner and reflect on what you are 
12935,because while you try to hold her there and constantly whisper how she is no good and can never do right.
12936,i will be there beside her constantly praising her and directing her to another world far from you. 
12937,"she will win, you will lose and one day she will wake and see you for the beast we know you to be. "
12938,all the misery all the pain all the tears and agony you have dished out
12939,will one day come to haunt you and bring you down 
12940,the way you have her. 
12941,while you huddle in a corner so lonely and cry your selfish tears. 
12942,she will be happy and free to live her life 
12943,and be able to finally become who she has always wanted to be.........
12944,you’re the devil on her shoulder i’m the angel 
12945,and in the end the good always wins...because you have to have her. 
12946,"i want to have her, you have to make her think you love her "
12947,i just smile and she knows...it’s a fair game 
12948,"let me show you who will win, it will not be you, it will not be me "
12949,but it will be her 
12950,and she will finally be the woman we know her to be. 
12951,i wish you well and bid you goodbye 
12952,because from this day you are nothing to me but a speck of dirt passing by 
12953,you credent you rodent goodbye!!!
12954,"tell me, how to love someone"

12975,and you make me sad

12979,i wouldn't have time to scream
12980,i wouldn't take the tears
12981,i wouldn't have these fears
12982,i would be able to love
12983,i could rise high above
12984,and even though i seem to hate
12985,i don't hate as i probably should
12986,"that i expect, you probably would"
12987,you hate everything and even yourself
12988,so i'll hang the presence of you
12989,upon my highest shelf
12990,even though you cause a hole in my heart
12991,"in years of time, you can always re-start."

13011,"i don’t need you, i'll do alright"
13012,i don’t need your blessing

13035,heck you don’t write either
13036,so your love i don’t see
13037,you’re not the one
13038,who wipes my tears at night
13039,nor are you the one
13040,who chases away my frights
13041,dear mom how could you
13042,just leave me like this
13043,you didn’t even come back
13044,for one last kiss
13045,mom how could you
13046,have a kid and just leave
13047,that’s no way to act
13048,that’s no way to behave
13049,dear mom i want to know why
13050,you decided not
13051,to be part of my life
13052,i want to know why
13053,you have no heart at all
13054,and how you can have a child
13055,"you don’t see, write, or call?"
13056,father of mine
13057,you weren't around to help me out.
13058,you left my life without any doubts.
13059,"you were never around to help me out, "
13060,you were always the one who would shout. 
13061,"violence was the answer for you, "
13062,well guess what?
13063,i'm growing up to be just like you. 
13064,i always wanted you around but no matter how hard i tried you would just make me cry.
13065,father of mine you're not a man. 
13066,to this day i won't forgive you.
13067,i have grown strong and i have been through a lot 
13068,but none of my strength comes from you 
13069,because your someone who never came through.
13070,why can't you love me and accept me for who i am?
13071,i always try my hardest; i do the best i can.
13072,can't you see how sad i've been?
13073,the way you treated me must have been a sin.
13074,"for a long time, i've tried to make you proud."
13075,"but instead of encouraging words, i get put down."
13076,stop trying to live my life for me.
13077,"i'm not a kid anymore, damn it, just let me be."
13078,"you don't like my friends, boyfriend, or anything i do."
13079,"tell me, what the hell did i ever do to you?"
13080,"you married a jerk, who disrespects me."
13081,"you always take his side, and turn against me."
13082,i've moved in with my dad and joan.
13083,they welcomed me with open arms; this is my new home.
13084,"they treat me with respect, and they love me for me."
13085,"no matter what, i'm here for them, and they're here for me."
13086,i've never felt this happy before; happiness for me was rare.
13087,"now that i'm happy in this new life of mine, do you even care?"
13088,father everlasting love
13089,falling in my pit of darkness
13090,i sit upon the black rose of sadness 
13091,dreaming of day fill with happiness 
13092,only to end with loneliness
13093,open eyes wonder why 
13094,looking at life pass by 
13095,my hollow eyes begin to fill with crimson tear
13096,as you still don't see the fear
13097,my life starts to darken
13098,as my heart become broken
13099,i am trap in shame 
13100,for you i blame 
13101,father everlasting love 
13102,the love i hold for you is dying 
13103,why do you keep on trying 
13104,listen to my story 
13105,for i do not feel sorry
13106,what’s wrong with you now 
13107,your smile is upside down 
13108,is it cause i'm taking a stand
13109,or that you now want to give a hand
13110,my love is never lasting
13111,you lost me years ago
13112,and so i let go
13113,you are my sickness that slowly seeps in my brain with each spoken word
13114,a disease that spreads throughout my body
13115,what about you?
13116,it's always about you
13117,what about me?
13118,why can't you just see what you are doing to me?
13119,i just hope your traits are not genetic
13120,i don't want to spread this disease any further
13121,death is the only antidote
13122,where did he go? he's right here
13123,the man who made me is not here.
13124,but the man who was here half my life and treated me like his daughter and the man who is by my side everyday is with me today. 
13125,that man is my step dad.
13126,the man who is not here for me is my daddy 
13127,"the man who called me his baby girl and his little punkin, and said he would always be here for me and never leave my side. "
13128,well you ain't here right now. 
13129,you screwed up are lives by doing drugs.

13133,i don't want to say i love you daddy i want to say that to him. 
13134,i don't want to cry on your shoulder when my boyfriend dumps me. 
13135,i want to see you move away and never come back.
13136,just a title
13137,just a title
13138,i am sorry to say
13139,we have no rapport
13140,better this way
13141,than playing pretend
13142,this is the way i have come to contend
13143,just a title
13144,i'm finally able to close the door
13145,you did this yourself
13146,all on your own
13147,i hope you like feeling alone
13148,i have tried too much
13149,now i am tired of holding the clutch
13150,just a title
13151,is what i have decided for
13152,you made your choice
13153,now you must lie
13154,now i see your chosen side
13155,just a title
13156,'mother' now i shut the door.
13157,can you hear me!
13158,can you hear me!
13159,where were you when the tears fell?
13160,when the blood began to flow?
13161,where were you when i was scared? 
13162,"when all my skies were gray,"
13163,and i lost all hope?
13164,where were you through all the years?
13165,when it all began? 
13166,"where were when i was hurt and bleeding, when i needed you?"
13167,where were you when i was sad and in jail?
13168,"when there was no strength left, "
13169,and where the hell are you now?
13170,"when it all came down and the walls were crashing in, "
13171,"all was lost and gone, and when i fought?"
13172,"where were you when i stayed up and cried myself to sleep each night, "
13173,and i tossed and turned? 
13174,and where are you now?
13175,that i'm stuck and there's nowhere to turn? 
13176,"so i ask you this where will you be, "
13177,when the walls come down again?
13178,where will you turn when the tables turn?
13179,and there is no wear to hide or no one to blame?
13180,"he pushes my sister in the cart,"
13181,in place of the man that tore us apart.
13182,"it's been a while since i've seen you last,"
13183,but now you're becoming a part of my past.
13184,i don't feel bad for the hatred i've shown.
13185,"dad you'll be amazed at how much i have grown,"
13186,"not only physically but emotionally too,"
13187,i've learned to live my life without you.
13188,"i've taught myself how to hate,"
13189,& dad it feels great.
13190,"moving on without you here,"
13191,learning to live with no fear.
13192,"now i'm cold, numb inside..."
13193,"love or hate dad, you decide.."
13194,i hope you understand
13195,"you were like a father,"
13196,"and my world was all clear,"
13197,"i wasn't expecting much from you at first,"
13198,"then you treated me like a daughter,"
13199,"i expected more then,"
13200,"i thought you would keep your promises,"
13201,and now i know.
13202,"you made my life a living nightmare,"
13203,"yet i still loved you like a father,"
13204,"i wasn't sure if forgiving you was right,"
13205,"but every time i did anyways,"
13206,"you had many chances and many opportunities,"
13207,but you used your last one.
13208,"i will always think of you as a father,"
13209,"but if that last chance wasn't blown we would be together,"
13210,"i hope you never think you were replaced,"
13211,"because i will always remember the good,"
13212,but the bad will be there too in my thoughts everyday.
13213,"your life means a lot to many different people,"
13214,"so please don't blow that too,"
13215,"because you only get one life and i love that life,"
13216,and i hope you do too.
13217,"every night i worry about what you are doing,"
13218,"and sometimes i cry wondering,"
13219,"i just wish life didn't have to be this way,"
13220,then i remember it doesn't.
13221,"i looked up to you and i wanted you to stay around forever,"
13222,"i wanted to grow up knowing you were always going to be there,"
13223,"now i am not sure that will happen,"
13224,"you are killing the thing i love most,"
13225,"so now i am begging you to stop,"
13226,i want you to spend the time you have left with me and your family.
13227,"we deserve better than to sit and watch you fade away,"
13228,"soon there won't be anything left,"
13229,think about these emotions and i hope you understand.
13230,learning my lesson
13231,"i gave you a chance, let you in and tried to be your friend,"
13232,"i should have known, you wouldn’t be there in the end."
13233,"i wanted you to love me, i waited for so very long,"
13234,"i didn’t want to feel the hurt, but you still did me wrong."
13235,"i always had hope, i never wanted it this way,"
13236,"no matter how hard i tried, you always pushed me away."
13237,"i should have known, you never really cared,"
13238,"you let us leave, you were never even scared."
13239,"we never turned back, your own brother helped us board."
13240,"never caring what was ahead, through it all we sure soared."
13241,"there were times, whether good or bad,"
13242,"when i was a little girl, i should of had my dad."
13243,"you weren’t there when i was young, you never got to see,"
13244,"you don’t have a clue, you don’t even know me."
13245,"every single birthday, they all went by,"
13246,"you never saw those candles go out, never my dad by my side."
13247,"but you should know, i had someone there,"
13248,"he’s special to me, and his name is ger."
13249,"but not even him can take away, all these years of pain, "
13250,"through all of this hurt, there is still a lot to gain."
13251,"without even knowing, you taught me good lessons for life,"
13252,"i will do what i can, because my husband deserves a good wife."
13253,"i will stick by his side, never let things go bad."
13254,"because i have chosen a man, who will always be a good dad."
13255,"you have made me wise, much more than my years,"
13256,"all this hurt and pain, i have learned a lot through the tears."
13257,"i have been so mature, much more than even you,"
13258,"what can i say, i guess you didn’t know what to do."
13259,"you think i don’t know, maybe it’s i didn’t want to,"
13260,"but me being younger, i will always be more mature than you."
13261,"i stand up for myself, believe in what i say,"
13262,"and always know, i treat people the right way."
13263,"there is no more to say, nothing more i can do."
13264,"any chance of a relationship for us, is now and forever through."
13265,"you threw that away, many years ago with the lies,"
13266,"funny thing though the truth, you must know, it never dies."
13267,"you were never there for us,"
13268,"when we needed you the most,"
13269,you would just disappear when things got tough.
13270,"and when we did spend time together, "
13271,"it would just end in promises that would later be broken, "
13272,and then you were gone giving us no reason at all.
13273,did you not think that we would care?
13274,was your life that bad that you had to go and end it there?
13275,were we not good enough for you?
13276,was that it?
13277,"my dad is never there,"
13278,my dad is always gone...
13279,"my dad really cares, "
13280,he just is never there...
13281,"i know he loves me so, "
13282,i just wish he would let it show..
13283,"i hate how he always leaves, "
13284,and stays away for so long..
13285,"i wish my daddy would show me love, "
13286,for i am his little girl...
13287,"please daddy, don't go...."
13288,mommy always misses you as i do too...
13289,"so why keep going, when it hurts us so????"
13290,red and hot 
13291,blazing or not 
13292,starts out small
13293,then into a hall
13294,with all its might
13295,angry and tough
13296,putting up a fight
13297,i am fire
13298,don't be sad when i die
13299,"when tomorrow starts without me,"
13300,"and i’m not there to comfort you,"
13301,"please know that i still love you,"
13302,cause i know you love me too.
13303,"when tomorrow starts without me,"
13304,"and you feel lost and blue,"
13305,i hope these words i’ve written
13306,will help to see you through.
13307,"someday your pain will ease,"
13308,sadness replaced by fond memories
13309,come tomorrow you will hear
13310,i love you whispered on the breeze.
13311,when tomorrow starts without me
13312,cause god has called me home
13313,"i turn, blowing a kiss for thee"
13314,sad that you may feel alone.
13315,i will miss you tomorrow
13316,as i take one last glimpse
13317,a tear falls from my cheek
13318,i’ll be going home.
13319,and tomorrow will start without me
13320,love in my life
13321,i married a man too early in life
13322,and wasn’t prepared to be a good wife.
13323,i believed he loved me and things would be fine.
13324,my love for him would grow over time. 
13325,the years passing by were good for awhile.
13326,then came a time i could not see my smile.
13327,he cheated on me and i deserved more.
13328,with a heavy heart i went out the door.
13329,"we parted as “friends”, which ended one day."
13330,with a baby conceived he went on his way.
13331,he now liked his freedom away from me.
13332,i carried our son -- he didn’t want to see.
13333,soon after another cared about me; 
13334,i ignored the things i didn’t want to see.
13335,i married that man -- i thought it’d be best.
13336,"but soon after that, he was failing the test."
13337,"driven by fear, i mistakenly thought"
13338,a son of “his own” was thing that he sought
13339,i now had a toddler and one on the way;
13340,"there was no doubt, i now had to stay."
13341,things started to spiral out of control.
13342,the alcohol had a firm grip his soul.
13343,choosing to leave to protect us all;
13344,i was forced this time to really stand tall.
13345,now on my own with two children to raise
13346,i examine my life in so many ways. 
13347,"my relationships failed, for that i am sad;"
13348,but the result of those could never be bad.
13349,now long gone are those men from my past
13350,replaced by a “true” love that forever will last.
13351,"my love for my sons, my two little boys, "
13352,erase all my pains and reveal only my joys.
13353,imagine a time...
13354,when everything was absolutely right.
13355,when you looked forward to 
13356,waking up the next day. 
13357,when you actually slept through the night. 
13358,when you finally felt peace.
13359,that everything is going to be alright.
13360,when all of a sudden your 
13361,"dreams, your hopes and strength "
13362,are gone forever.
13363,all you want to do is scream 
13364,"""please god, tell me it's a dream!"" "
13365,when you wake in the morning 
13366,to realize its reality. 
13367,you try to fight the finality. 
13368,you need just a little bit of normality.
13369,"you try not to think of ""why"" "
13370,all you do is cry. 
13371,"you try to be angry with god, "
13372,but end up angry at yourself.
13373,"""why didn't i just stay home that day?"" "
13374,"""why can't anything ever go my way?"""
13375,you crawl out of bed. 
13376,decide to give life another whirl. 
13377,you reach out. 
13378,some reach back. 
13379,some don't even call back. 
13380,just when you thought you had no more to lose.
13381,you do. 
13382,these people you thought to be friends just wanted you to use.
13383,"so you lay back down just wanting to snooze, thinking why me? "
13384,is it how i choose?
13385,you begin to give up. 
13386,you don't see a reason any longer 
13387,to even wake up. 
13388,then all of a sudden you hear 
13389,the sound of the phone ring or 
13390,a knock on the door. 
13391,"someone there to tell you not to give up, "
13392,you're worth so much more. 
13393,you begin to cry while this other person 
13394,is wondering why. 
13395,you try to say 
13396,"""thank you for being my friend today, "
13397,if it weren't for you i would’ve given up
13398,"you now know the answer of ""why""."
13399,it’s to remind you 
13400,to never give up 
13401,and to always try. 
13402,now when i cry i know and don’t ask why.
13403,i get out of bed and again i try.
13404,don't look back
13405,just keep on walking
13406,a small voice said
13407,don’t dare look back
13408,look straight ahead
13409,yes so many things
13410,think they'd stay
13411,as you arranged?
13412,be strong and brave
13413,calm your fears
13414,keep that chin up
13415,dry your tears.
13416,yes love hurt
13417,and broke your heart
13418,keep your head
13419,and heart apart.
13420,don’t cry over
13421,what you have had
13422,at least you had it
13423,don't be sad.
13424,this will be tough
13425,but time will heal
13426,perhaps a new life
13427,will then reveal.
13428,you are not new
13429,to this whole game
13430,you gave your best
13431,you're not to blame.
13432,the hardest thing 
13433,there is to do
13434,is love someone
13435,who not loves you.
13436,so is it worth it
13437,what's to gain 
13438,when you love someone
13439,who brings you pain?
13440,just walk away
13441,and stand up tall
13442,count your blessings
13443,one and all!
13444,a different kind of hero
13445,a hero to me is not just a person who died for there country or went inside a burning building or stuff like that. 
13446,a hero to me is a single mother who survives everyday by herself. 
13447,a teenager against all odds getting through life. 
13448,an alcoholic walking into a rehab center. 
13449,"a father being not just a father but a friend, a caregiver, supporter, a brick wall for his kids. "
13450,"a friend who no matter what or how wrong you are standing up for you and taking your side. a hero who no matter how hard they are being hit or pushed or beat down, "
13451,no matter how bad they are emotionally or physically or psychologically they stand up and keep going. 
13452,"they push through the pain of life, love, kids, work, school, drugs, sports, parents, heartbreak, alcohol, that to me is a hero. "
13453,"a person who isn’t just there, but is there living, breathing, and surviving."
13454,time to stop struggling
13455,"life is unfair, sometimes the misery we can't bear.. "
13456,this was a feeling i could never share...
13457,"i am strong, strong enough to move on from this pain, "
13458,"i won't feel the shame, my life is not a game, "
13459,tired of these tears and my fears... 
13460,i will cherish my inspirations... 
13461,"i will find my dream, i promise, that's what i will achieve.. "
13462,i will find a way to leave.. 
13463,i'm not who you will deceive.. 
13464,"i believe in miracles, these people laugh like it's hysterical... "
13465,"i won't fall, i may be lost but i will be found..."
13466,"one day i will find the perfect life, life will run beautifully, i will fly like a butterfly through the night, will have a pleasant sight, afraid but i will fight... "
13467,"no boundaries, free my mind of all the pressure, leaving here will be my pleasure.. "
13468,"i want so much to be free, so much i want to see... "
13469,"i want to reach the sky, i want so bad too fly... "
13470,"see, i use to be a fool when i let you treat me cruel... "
13471,i made a mistake but i wont let my self break.. 
13472,"leave me, for gods sake... "
13473,"so now i kneel down to pray, for these times of struggle i will just say, i'll leave in your hands. god, i will let go.."
13474,sometimes we see things that aren’t meant to be seen.
13475,sometimes things aren’t always as they seem.
13476,"sometimes we need someone to call our own,"
13477,especially when we’re alone.
13478,"sometimes people just can’t understand,"
13479,why things get out of hand.
13480,"sometimes life just isn’t fair,"
13481,especially when people just don’t care.
13482,"and sometimes it's hard to say,"
13483,why things have to be this way.
13484,"sometimes it’s all you can do to get by,"
13485,especially when dreams continue to die.
13486,sometimes it’s nice to sit in the rain.
13487,even to just relieve the pain.
13488,"and when we’ve had a really bad day,"
13489,sometimes we just need to get away.
13490,we never know what’s wrong with out pain.
13491,sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.
13492,"and sometimes when people get hurt, "
13493,even the strongest ones may need comfort.
13494,"life is not just waking up one morning and saying ok i want this to happen, "
13495,it's about getting out there and going for it. . . .
13496,"life is full of surprises, "
13497,"here, there and everywhere, "
13498,"you never know where you will end up, "
13499,"or who you will end up with, "
13500,you just have to trust your faith and keep god close.
13501,"never say never cause you know you can do it, "
13502,"never say later do it right now, "
13503,"never let people bring you down, "
13504,"they will do anything to watch you fall, "
13505,"so keep your head up and your heart strong, "
13506,and then my dear you can never go wrong.
13507,a wing and a prayer
13508,"under the wing of an angel, we feel protected"
13509,"through prayers to god, we feel connected"
13510,peace is said to be offered on the wings of a dove
13511,"prayers can bring peace along with hope, faith, and love"
13512,wings of a jet plane provide steady flight
13513,i pray you remain steady and strong through this fight
13514,butterflies have wings to fly playfully free
13515,and free from this monster is what i pray you'll soon be
13516,birds spread their wings as they may leave their nest
13517,we're spreading our prayers that you'll always be blessed
13518,go fight and win this battle you didn't start
13519,on the wings of an angel and prayers from my heart
13520,i have had
13521,some were good though most were bad 
13522,physical and sexual abuse occurred 
13523,and madness and sadness reoccurred
13524,i feel as though i'm on display as carley the messed up school girl here to stay
13525,but they will never know 
13526,how i will grow 
13527,and be someone some day
13528,so look at me in dismay 
13529,and you discourage me for the last time today.
13530,life will go on
13531,when i was little 
13532,my life was great 
13533,but as i got older me and my mom were becoming farther apart 
13534,my mom no longer cares for me 
13535,she left me alone
13536,she never wants to talk
13537,or give kisses and hugs
13538,she just don't care anymore
13539,i used to try to take all my anger out on myself by trying to take drugs and drinking
13540,but now i realize that mom don't care and she never will
13541,so i'm trying to become something great 
13542,something not like her
13543,i hate the fact that she's not around 
13544,but i have learned to deal with it
13545,if she doesn't want to be with me 
13546,why should i want to be with her
13547,i have learned that even if you love someone they might not feel the same about you
13548,even if it is your daughter
13549,i have learned to deal with life as it comes deal with it the best you can and don't let other people control your life
13550,life will go on as long as you let it
13551,life is hard
13552,our world is nothing don't you see 
13553,there's people with money and there's people like me 
13554,my life has never been anything or made me proud to see
13555,every day there's more troubles for me to carry around 
13556,there's shooting and killing and guns all around
13557,i'm tired of waking up and hearing one of my people are down
13558,i'm black and hispanic and its hard to get around 
13559,some busses won't pick me up but i don't cause problems around
13560,racism is something i'm tired of being around 
13561,but i'm me and i'm going to stand tall and still get around 
13562,no matter how much hell is coming around
13563,our outrageous day
13564,"what do you think washington would say,"
13565,if he saw the way our country operates?
13566,"no bibles allowed in schools,"
13567,"everyone calling christians fools,"
13568,"hatred toward the founding beliefs, "
13569,officials lying to keep their seats.
13570,"everything done today,"
13571,would be outrageous in his day.
13572,"we are fine with drinking and drugs,"
13573,because our country is run by thugs.
13574,"we want to take the rights of the parent,"
13575,to somehow protect the children?
13576,"we need to take a stand, "
13577,to stop sin in this christian founded land.
13578,"all of our forefather's broken laws,"
13579,"are a good enough cause,"
13580,"to rebel against the coming evil,"
13581,which can be stopped at will.
13582,we just need to take a stand.
13583,gliding deep into the forest
13584,darkness covers me like a blanket
13585,and the mist surrounding me
13586,i feel like there's no way to flee
13587,i look beyond the broad horizon
13588,see the moon shine over the sea
13589,like the oceans filled with sadness
13590,"i run, stumble and try to break free"
13591,the path encloses and i’m shattered
13592,tears of rain encumbers me
13593,darkness embraces me like a child
13594,now i wait for him to let me be
13595,my one true life
13596,"one true story,"
13597,"told by a child,"
13598,that she was wild.
13599,"but it was her cousin,"
13600,"who exceeded the truth,"
13601,"but that was only when,"
13602,they were in their youth.
13603,"all grown up,"
13604,"getting ready to go,"
13605,"bad little streets,"
13606,they didn’t know.
13607,"her parents thought,"
13608,"she was a lie,"
13609,"but they were wrong,"
13610,they said goodbye.
13611,"just like a slave,"
13612,"to never come back,"
13613,"live your life,"
13614,"and do what you do,"
13615,"become the wife,"
13616,"that you want to,"
13617,"get a job,"
13618,"just be you,"
13619,"because by the end of the day,"
13620,that is only thing you can do…
13621,too broken to break
13622,"here’s to the girl with the invincible spirit,"
13623,no matter how confused her soul may be.
13624,"she’s been broken many times,"
13625,searching for love that was just not there.
13626,"she’s learned her lesson now, put up her wall,"
13627,and never again her heart she’ll bare.
13628,"for she realized that in the end a body is still a body,"
13629,"no matter who’s it may be,"
13630,and love may not exist for anyone 
13631,so we should all just settle and it’ll be easy.
13632,"but she’ll never give in,"
13633,"all she needs is herself, and who ever she is that day,"
13634,"but this she’ll never know,"
13635,because life is surreal
13636,when all she does is feel.
13637,"she thinks with her passion,"
13638,sees the world through her heart
13639,"even though many times it’s cold, desolate, and dark."
13640,"yet at the same time she can see that there may be hope out there,"
13641,the one nobody else possibly can.
13642,"she’s a dreamer and an idealist,"
13643,life’s greatest pessimist and realist.
13644,"she’s a contradiction sure,"
13645,"but never a hypocrite,"
13646,because in her soul this all somehow fits.
13647,"she wants to explore the world just to understand what she’s thinking,"
13648,dig into the deepest corners of her heart to understand the universe.
13649,"she often loses herself though,"
13650,and who she used to be she can never know.
13651,"yet she’s happy like this,"
13652,"she’s free and to no one she’ll commit,"
13653,"except sometimes when she’s all alone,"
13654,she just wants some place she can call home.
13655,"she knows every side of every story,"
13656,"because she has felt absolutely everything,"
13657,often all at once.
13658,"this ability to see in ways that no one else can,"
13659,is it a curse or is it a gift?
13660,"even she cannot understand how or when or why or what,"
13661,and sometimes she doesn’t even know if it is.
13662,"she wants something more,"
13663,even when she is sure there’s nothing else out there.
13664,"but no, she’ll never settle,"
13665,"especially for a love, if that even does exist."
13666,she’ll always hope there’s something out there to bring her bliss. but she doesn’t expect it and convinces herself she doesn’t want it.
13667,this is how her spirit is infinite.
13668,"oh, how i hope there’s something more than this."
13669,when it happened
13670,i was too young to know
13671,how much this affected him
13672,how much it took from him
13673,he forgot who he was
13674,he forgot how to shove food in his face
13675,he lost his mind
13676,he lost his place
13677,his case was called an aneurysm
13678,his brain had dysfunction
13679,he could not talk anymore
13680,he could not walk anymore
13681,we all thought he was done
13682,we thought he would give up
13683,but he never quit
13684,he saw what he wanted
13685,he saw what he needed
13686,and he had succeeded
13687,his vessel had bled
13688,his head had sped over the limit
13689,but still he never stopped
13690,he never turned away
13691,and he is the grandpa
13692,that i love today
13693,you may see me struggle 
13694,but you won't see me fall. 
13695,regardless if i'm weak or not i'm going to stand tall. 
13696,everyone says life is easy 
13697,but truly living it is not.
13698,"times get hard, "
13699,and constantly get put on the spot. 
13700,i'm going to wear the biggest smile 
13701,even though i want to cry. 
13702,i'm going to fight to live 
13703,even though i'm destined to die. 
13704,and even though it's hard and i may struggle through it all. 
13705,you see me struggle...you will never see me fall.
13706,"in life there are people that will hurt us and cause us pain,"
13707,but we must learn to forgive and forget and not hold grudges.
13708,"in life there are mistakes we will make,"
13709,but we must learn from our wrongs and grow from them.
13710,"in life there are regrets we will have to live with, "
13711,but we must learn to leave the past behind and realize it is something we can't change.
13712,"in life there are people we will loose forever and can't have back,"
13713,but we must learn to let go & move on.
13714,"in life there are going to be obstacles that will cause interference,"
13715,but we must learn to overcome these challenges and grow stronger.
13716,"in life there are fears that will hold us back from what we want,"
13717,but we must learn to fight them with the courage from within.
13718,god holds our lives in his hands. he holds the key to our future. 
13719,only he knows our fate. 
13720,he see's everything and knows everything. 
13721,"everything in life really does happen for a reason: ""god's reason""."
13722,the road to success is not straight
13723,"there is a curve called failure, "
13724,"a loop called confusion,"
13725,"speed bumps called friends, "
13726,"red lights called enemies, and"
13727,caution lights called family
13728,"but if you have a spare called determination,"
13729,"an engine called perseverance,"
13730,"insurance called faith, and"
13731,"a driver called jesus,"
13732,you will make it to a place called success!!
13733,never let go
13734,one by one
13735,take one step at a time
13736,"said her daddy, teaching her to walk"
13737,the little girl only one year old
13738,she looked up and smiled
13739,and let go of his hand.
13740,now seventeen years old
13741,out driving in the snow
13742,"driving to fast, hitting a pole"
13743,after getting the news
13744,her dad rushes to her
13745,hearing the terrible
13746,"news, she may never walk again."
13747,"one by one, my dear"
13748,take one step at a time
13749,said her daddy teaching
13750,her to walk again.
13751,she looked up with a smile
13752,as she did sixteen years ago and
13753,"let go of his hand, for the last time."
13754,never stop caring about the little things in life
13755,never stop dreaming or give into strife
13756,"never stop wondering, are we on our own"
13757,never stop thinking has your spirituality grown
13758,never stop building bridges that leads to better tomorrows
13759,never stop trying or give into sorrow
13760,never stop feeling amazed at the beauty that surrounds you
13761,never stop hearing the music or give into the blues
13762,never stop pushing away negative thoughts that make you feel sad
13763,never stop looking at the all the miracles we have had
13764,never stop loving the ones you hold dear
13765,never stop giving or give into the fear
13766,never stop smiling and look forward to each new day
13767,never stop shining in your own special way
13768,never forget that all storms will clear
13769,remember brighter tomorrows are always near
13770,my morals define me
13771,i have never done drugs and never will. i don't give into peer pressure. i believe that drugs are lame. drugs cause you to make irresponsible decisions. i'd rather be high on life than high on drugs. i choose not to harm my body with illegal substances. i do what i want and if this makes me a loser than so be it.
13772,"i am proud to be a virgin. i'm not ditzy or dumb. i don't believe everything i am told. abstinence is the key, so i believe. i am not ready for a child nor disgusting diseases. my virginity is my sanctuary. if this makes me a loser than so be it."
13773,violence is never the answer . physical disputes are pointless and solve nothing. it is unnecessary and a waste of time. i shall never stoop down to that level of immaturity. i'd rather walk away and be the bigger person. if this makes me a loser than so be it. 
13774,"being a party girl is not who i am. partying is not what life is all about. life does not revolve around alcohol, drugs, and music. there are more important things in life than parties. i have the rest of my life to party, for now i choose to focus on my future and career. if this makes me a loser than so be it."
13775,i don't need to dress like a hoochie to get attention. i am classy not trashy. i'd rather be noticed for my intelligence than my looks. i choose to have dignity and respect for my body. i'd rather be liked for who i am than for what i look like. if this makes me a loser than so be it.
13776,"i am not a follower, i control my own mind and make my own decisions. i stand up for what i believe in and defend my opinions. i'd rather be hated for being myself than liked for someone i am not. if this makes me a loser than so be it."
13777,"i am unique and one of a kind. i am who i am, and will never change for anyone. i will always be me, now and forever. if this makes me a loser than maybe i am."
13778,am not a victim of breast cancer
13779,i am not a victim of breast cancer. i am experiencing breast cancer.
13780,i am not dying. i am living.
13781,i am not curing. i am healing and restoring.
13782,i am not fearing. i am loving and trusting.
13783,i am not fighting. i am ceasing all hostility and conflict.
13784,i am not weak or diminished. i am strong and whole and complete.
13785,"i am not coping or hoping. i am giving and receiving, creating and conceiving."
13786,i am not crying. i am laughing until the tears run down my leg.
13787,"my body is not my enemy. my body is my loving friend, my gentle guide."
13788,my life story is not history. my life story is legendary.
13789,i am not powerless. i am powerful beyond measure.
13790,i am not a drop in the ocean. i am the ocean in a drop.
13791,i am not scattered. i am aligned.
13792,i am not being destroyed. i am building my sacred stature.
13793,i am not trapped or caged. i am as free as a feathery fledgling.
13794,my body is not a muddy puddle of despair. my body is a hallowed temple of spirit.
13795,i am not filled with shadows. i am filled with illuminating light.
13796,i am not a passive puppet. i am an active advocate and enthusiastic participant.
13797,i am not tired and bested. i am tied and invested.
13798,i am not without a voice or meaning or purpose. i am an angelic messenger.
13799,i am not discarded. i am needed.
13800,"i am not descending, dragging or faltering. i am consistently inspiring and uplifting."
13801,i am not dwelling in the reflections of the past or the projections of the future. i am joyfully dancing naked in the unfolding mystery of the present moment.
13802,"i am not alone or abandoned. i am infinitely connected by the soft, silky vibrational threads of love."
13803,i will not forget. i will remember.
13804,i will not burn out. i will sparkle forever.
13805,you say you’re afraid of being alone
13806,you can’t do a thing on your own
13807,you don’t know where to get the courage
13808,to overcome those fears that bother you
13809,i sensed that you needed somebody
13810,and now i’m here to fill that somebody
13811,never to leave you alone
13812,so you can stand on your own
13813,"remember what i’ve told you,"
13814,that fear is only in the mind?
13815,"i believe that you can make it, just like me…"
13816,"because, for once, i’m also afraid"
13817,and i don’t know where to get the strength
13818,to overcome my weakness
13819,"now, i am brave enough to stand beside you"
13820,"yes, i am brave enough…"
13821,"maybe you’ll ask, “why are you brave enough?”"
13822,my answer is simple and true:
13823,“i’m brave enough because of you”
13824,"the day is through, the sun is down,"
13825,only the moon seems to be up.
13826,"i go to bed, i lay to rest,"
13827,"i open my eyes, as into the world i step."
13828,"i see green meadows, i feel the sun,"
13829,i feel content as i look around.
13830,"i keep on walking down the lane,"
13831,i hear the giggles of kids at play.
13832,"so many faces all come in glee,"
13833,"the cheer, the laughter, everyone at peace."
13834,"singing and dancing, all around one man,"
13835,i take a step forward to join in the clan.
13836,"we all come together, no color no race,"
13837,"we all want to shout out and to him give praise,"
13838,"our pastor, our savior, our only true love,"
13839,"the reign of mankind, if only in him we trust."
13840,"no rain, no pain, no evil, no shame"
13841,"this is my world, it is yours too."
13842,"no tears, no fears, no aches, no blame"
13843,"this is my world, i share it with you."
13844,fear itself is undefined
13845,"i lay on my bed soaking my pillow with my tears,"
13846,i try to remember exactly what it is that i fear.
13847,is it the passing of time or the love that i lack?
13848,is it the mistakes that i've made or the fact that i can't bring the past back?
13849,what is it that i'm afraid of? 
13850,why am i so scared?
13851,is it the people i've hurt or the people that have hurt me?
13852,am i afraid of everything that i cant seem to see?
13853,"is it the love of a friend, or the loss of my family?"
13854,is it the possibility that my life can end in a tragedy? 
13855,what is it that i fear most? 
13856,what do my eyes say i'm scared of? 
13857,is it the sun that sets but won't seem to rise?
13858,is it the hope that i have that always seems to die?
13859,is it the trust of a person that i cannot begin to grasp?
13860,is it all the memories of my horrid past?
13861,is it me? 
13862,can it possibly be that the thing i fear most is the thing i can't be? 
13863,the things that i try to understand? 
13864,the me that i try to be with when i'm feeling sad? 
13865,the person i'm expected to be? is that what i fear? . . . 
13866,i think the thing i fear most . . .is me
13867,"a plethora of predicaments race in my mind at best, "
13868,which one can i fathom to ponder about next. 
13869,"shall i even think of acting upon what my mind stirs about, "
13870,or cry my soul asleep by this never ending drought. 
13871,"what will my career be, "
13872,the words last resort come screaming at me with no one to yell halt. 
13873,the quick years will pass then they will hit me and it's my own fault. 
13874,"all of my solutions come bearing a bag of infinite errors, "
13875,my late night thoughts give me shrieking terrors. 
13876,at what point in time does this maze come to a close. 
13877,on the inside i am slowly weeping but on the outside i pose. 
13878,i look around my room and it does not express myself. 
13879,question creeps in my eyes at the princess sign of the shelf. 
13880,"i am feeling confusion, don't worry not despair. "
13881,all i really want in this life is to be without a care.
13882,he is here
13883,"when her mother gone, "
13884,"the little child's body feels revealed,"
13885,"for the shadows speaks, you are not alone."
13886,"close the shower curtains, cover any holes and doors; "
13887,i am afraid he can see you even more.
13888,"he is listening to all calls, quiet, we have to be careful, what we say,"
13889,"can you hear him breathing … dogs barking through the phone? he is tapping in, everyday."
13890,"lounging in his recliner, daring any distractions in front of his screen, if you dare to cross it, there will a tree on your back, with blood easy to be seen."
13891,"so never forget, once you cross him, you will be repaid, for he will always be watching, for a mess up, to get you that day."
13892,"with our friends, he tickled or hugged,"
13893,"sexually and inappropriately, why? just because."
13894,"jealous of the children, for his mind is like a child, needy at all times."
13895,"wanting all attention from mommy, and if not gained, for this little child, she says, pain will be mine."
13896,"off from work he comes, releasing all anger held inside."
13897,"i am hiding in my room as a child, covered ears, as tears rolled from my eyes."
13898,"mommy cries from the mental affects, i assured her it ok, but his voice shouted, he wanted me out of the way."
13899,"he said the boys were always a sin, for being a male, told his story from before, all were afraid of him, even for a date, was an ungodly knock at door."
13900,"in dreams, he touched, manipulated and lied, as an adult predator, in the midnight hour, mommy, please come home save me, i am telling the truth, your child not a liar."
13901,"wanting, not grateful for all that he can get, smiling, while fake as can be,"
13902,"after getting what he wants, he turns on you, stinging like a bee."
13903,"mommy please do not let him punish in anger, with a belt in his hand firm and anchored, but let it be in love, please jesus, help me from above."
13904,"never to love the children, he rather seek selfish desires, we will always be his enemies, in memory, his abuse remain ours."
13905,how do you?
13906,how do you tell a friend that you are worried about them?
13907,that you think that they are not making good decisions right now.
13908,that it scares you to see them like this.
13909,"you know that you will be there for them, but how do you make them see that?"
13910,how do you tell them so they don't get mad?
13911,do you tell them straight up so they deny it saying they are ok?
13912,it's complicated no matter who you are.
13913,it hurts to see your friends like this.
13914,you don't want to push them away because you have a special bond.
13915,"so how do you tell someone you love, this?"
13916,there is no easy way.
13917,"me, god and the devil"
13918,i've been tainted and shamed
13919,behind my pretty facade
13920,impured by lust and passion
13921,corrupted by silly illusions
13922,my soul more broken than my heart.
13923,no saint can save me now
13924,i'm a sinner with no savior
13925,so i ask god to just take me now
13926,i want to feel numb forever
13927,"numb, cold, and dead."
13928,i didn't know innocence can be a sin
13929,accessory to evil plots
13930,i fell against his will
13931,"leaving me hopelessly scared, "
13932,trapped and good as dead.
13933,no one knows i've got a secret
13934,a secret i couldn't trust someone to keep
13935,no one knows what i went through
13936,the pain and misery i still feel
13937,"no one knows except me, god, and the devil too."
13938,when i was little you abused me in every way
13939,you hurt me and didn't care because you felt no
13940,when i was little i didn't know what you were
13941,doing wasn't okay.
13942,when i was little i would cry myself to sleep
13943,i would try to hide the tears and try to hide 
13944,from the pain.
13945,bruises all over no more lies to cover up
13946,now no one to talk to because of the pain.
13947,finally one day i came to a crossroad do i tell
13948,or just stay hidden beneath the covers all day?
13949,you now are in prison but i still feel the pain 
13950,i don't want to cry no more because it's tearing me 
13951,so for you dear daddy i won't shed another tear
13952,"suicide tempts me every time i swallow, "
13953,"all because this destructive life lead, "
13954,and the paths i follow. 
13955,"i'm invisible to myself,"
13956,and will soon be to everyone who once cared. 
13957,"many never believed me, "
13958,others always dared. 
13959,hurting everyone whomever had my back. 
13960,the only way i deserve to leave this world is in a black polyester sack. 
13961,"my life, "
13962,"what life, "
13963,"is all down the drain, "
13964,the only love of my life and all my family left in pain.
13965,"i'm sorry everyone, "
13966,"i'm sorry for all i've done, "
13967,"but the pain will end now, "
13968,it will all end once i'm gone. 
13969,"a slice to wrist, "
13970,"a cut to the throat, "
13971,sleeping pills for the pain hallucinating of being afloat. 
13972,"lifting to the heaven that i could only dream, "
13973,blood dripping from my torso like melting ice cream. 
13974,"no breath, "
13975,"no life, "
13976,"no soul, "
13977,"i'm sorry mom,"
13978,"i'm sorry dad, "
13979,but finally i feel like i can unfold.
13980,cry for help!!!
13981,i thirst for help before it’s to late..... 
13982,i stand alone in the darkness as i lay......
13983,the might of his fist feels like burning coal.....
13984,the power of his kick ordains the soul...... 
13985,the fire in his eyes makes you blind....
13986,but my cry for help you can not find..... 
13987,i need help and someone to help me now....
13988,he won’t let me leave him so i don't know how.....
13989,he is passive and controlling...... 
13990,as he push me around my body rolling...... 
13991,i don't think i can save myself......
13992,someone listen to my cry for help!!!
13993,i wish i knew who i am
13994,you tell me you love me 
13995,i tell you the same
13996,i don't know who i am 
13997,it's a shame it's insane
13998,i want to love me and you 
13999,like i love my own son
14000,inside i feel dead 
14001,and i'm totally numb
14002,i prick my finger 
14003,from a rose with a thorn
14004,a reminder that our children 
14005,are of the purest of form
14006,a mirror reflection of body we are
14007,the more i look the more that i scar
14008,the more that i scar the better i feel
14009,in this crazy world that seems oh so unreal
14010,the whole world is my stage 
14011,it helps cover my fear
14012,for we are all merely actors 
14013,according to shakespeare
14014,when i speak of the truth it feels like a noose
14015,that's slowly stretching my neck
14016,and then when i lie the noose opens wide
14017,and postpones the decent to my death
14018,i feel so amused or maybe confused
14019,of the thoughts that run through my head
14020,its just so unfair with these thoughts i compare
14021,my whole life i just can't stay ahead
14022,is it me is it you
14023,is it life is it truth
14024,is it destiny or time
14025,is it yours is it mine
14026,i don't know but i hope it comes soon
14027,because it hurts
14028,she wears my shoes
14029,"she rode on my wings, "
14030,"shared her dreams, "
14031,and lit my life with such a glow.
14032,"i was her protector, teacher and friend, "
14033,and will be her mother until my end 
14034,"i made a lot of mistakes not knowing the cost in the end, "
14035,i never intended to hand down the same shoes my mother handed me. 
14036,but i see that is what i did. 
14037,and crushing all her dreams. 
14038,"it has been over four years since we have last spoken, "
14039,"but never a day passes that i don't send my love to the stars above, "
14040,and ask for an angel to open up their wings 
14041,and take my place and guide her to follow all her dreams. 
14042,"she will always have a place in my heart that will never be replaced, "
14043,this is how a mothers love was always meant to be.
14044,"i hope that someday our paths will cross again, "
14045,and i can hold her in my arms 
14046,and tell her i understand better than she could ever know
14047,i understand what i did in passing the shoes to her.
14048,"if i could take it all back, believe me i would."
14049,"but, for now it’s out of my hands."
14050,why do i stay when i want to go?
14051,is it because i have hope?
14052,or maybe it is because i don’t want to be alone.
14053,i stay and all i do is complain.
14054,complain that i might be going insane.
14055,insane of the thought that it might be my fault.
14056,but who is to blame?
14057,is it me or is it him?
14058,neither one of us will go.
14059,although we know we must go.
14060,all we do is ignore the pain.
14061,of all the words we exchange.
14062,i know i must go but i don’t know.
14063,if i go i will be alone.
14064,but why do i stay?
14065,only to hear him say
14066,“you’re to blame for all my unhappiness and pain.”
14067,i know i’m not to blame for the choices he has made.
14068,so i stay hoping he will grow.
14069,grow in love and be consoled knowing i will never go.
14070,i thank you
14071,you kept it real
14072,you told no lies
14073,i trusted your words
14074,and you said that it was okay to cry
14075,hidden from an ocean of lies from the
14076,people closest to me....
14077,"but you, you revealed them all"
14078,you answered questions never asked
14079,and you showed no regret
14080,and with that i thank you!
14081,wishing the truth were lies
14082,expecting a laugh and you telling me
14083,that it was all a
14084,"the truth hit me, then stabbed me, then"
14085,killed me a thousand
14086,i cried that night with the never ending
14087,thought of the truth....
14088,i thought i knew my life i thought i
14089,understood it all....
14090,but you opened my eyes and unwrapped
14091,the hurtful truth....
14092,"and i thank you for being there, to hold"
14093,my hand....through it all....
14094,and i can never thank you enough for
14095,opening the closet of skeletons....
14096,"the vessel's memories haunt the gloom of the night,"
14097,"i survey its changed shape since days of yore,"
14098,"as i stumble, tremble and fumble to the fore,"
14099,"the mute faces stare with hope as they might,"
14100,"dreaming of the new world's coming at first light,"
14101,"the pining youth cross the threshold of the door,"
14102,they are visibly stricken and shaken to the core;
14103,"we are ghastly, haggard shells and filled with fright,"
14104,as our modern voyage sails into the shades of night.
14105,my heart breaks;
14106,"a mother's fears,"
14107,"a sister's tears,"
14108,"my soul quakes,"
14109,"a brother nears,"
14110,my earth shakes.
14111,the winds are wild
14112,the lightning strikes
14113,the thunder booms
14114,the storm is coming
14115,the storm represents your fears
14116,and all that you have run away from
14117,they’ve come back for their revenge
14118,will you face it or run away?
14119,"run away, like you did before"
14120,"let your friends fall, like you did before"
14121,"or face it, like you should"
14122,"help them, like you should"
14123,chin held high and heart strong
14124,your blood races
14125,"the lighting strikes, the thunder booms"
14126,you will not run away
14127,you will fight
14128,but not getting to far.
14129,"the path your on,"
14130,will cause you no change.
14131,"but in your deepest dreams,"
14132,you suffer much pain.
14133,"will you expand yourself,"
14134,or sit and cry?
14135,"you want comfort, warmth"
14136,"and by yourself,"
14137,it's like catching smoke.
14138,"you bend and twist,"
14139,you scream and yell.
14140,for what can you do
14141,when it feels like hell.
14142,frozen to the path..
14143,curse of the circle!
14144,"the truth is that she doesn't have, "
14145,but what she needs to know
14146,this life she leads leaves so much space 
14147,for seeds that need to grow
14148,"what happened then, before this time, "
14149,how did it come to be?
14150,that she would find herself 
14151,so hurt and longing to be free
14152,the stories told do not ring true 
14153,to what's inside her head
14154,"why can't she live each day with joy, "
14155,not such an aching dread?
14156,when will the past come forth 
14157,to show her how it all began?
14158,"till then she grieves in lonesome silence, "
14159,coping while she can
14160,i sit here holding deep inside
14161,feelings that others wish to hide
14162,"confide in me, the troubles go"
14163,but in me they grow and grow.
14164,i know i said i could handle it
14165,but i wonder as i think about it.
14166,my heart screams for sweet release
14167,all it wants is the promise of peace
14168,the promise i freely give to others
14169,can i promise myself above others?
14170,i’ll let my promise out to you
14171,if you will hold me as i would you.
14172,i'll trust you if you will me
14173,"god please, protect me. "
14174,hold me and never let me go
14175,"but if you do, i want you to know."
14176,i never meant to go away
14177,my heart released it’s own way
14178,perhaps through fear it decided to go.
14179,"but if that’s it, i did not know."
14180,sometimes it acts without me
14181,"but if so, now i am free."
14182,fear is only in our minds taking over all our time
14183,from the weirdest dream...
14184,i look i realize
14185,it wasn’t a dream
14186,the car crash
14187,i’m lying in the road
14188,in so much pain
14189,lying in a pool of blood
14190,jagged pieces of glass stab
14191,barely staying awake
14192,wanting to scream
14193,in the distance i hear sirens
14194,it must be an ambulance
14195,everything is going all hazy and black
14196,i see blurred figures running up to me
14197,there trying to save me
14198,i’m not ready to die
14199,someone should have told that kid
14200,not to drink and drive
14201,and now i must die
14202,because no one cared to tell him not to drink and drive
14203,as i lie here my breath getting shorter
14204,on the cold unforgiving road
14205,all i can think about is...
14206,nothing can save me now
14207,she walks alone in the dark.
14208,as she looks back there are sparks.
14209,"she can hear the whispers, "
14210,"the steps, the jumps. "
14211,"she can hear the quickness, "
14212,just like darts. 
14213,"she walks at a pace, "
14214,not to fast. 
14215,"she hears the whispers, "
14216,this makes her gasp. 
14217,"she runs as fast as she can,"
14218,"until she hears the steps again, "
14219,a hollow speech hard and cold. 
14220,"she wants to run but, "
14221,it's to bold. 
14222,"she runs and runs,"
14223,"until she finds, "
14224,"the sound was the wind, "
14225,so she walks again.
14226,best of brands
14227,"get that nit comb through those strands,"
14228,"this lice lotion best of brands,"
14229,"nought point nought between the prongs,"
14230,"not short hair, but two foot long."
14231,"look they’re dying, i think we’re winning,"
14232,"eyes all bloodshot, red and stinging."
14233,"don’t be silly, don’t start to wine,"
14234,mummy’s got to be cruel to be kind.
14235,crisis over! what do you think?
14236,still got to get rid of that terrible stink.
14237,"back to school, back to civilization."
14238,ready to pick up another infestation!
14239,my horse is there in front of me
14240,clip-cloppin' down the road.
14241,he stops and flips his tail straight up
14242,and drops another load.
14243,"my cows dump in the meadow,"
14244,"my chickens foul their coop,"
14245,and flies are buzzin' 'round and 'round
14246,eatin' all that poop.
14247,the sheep are out there bleatin'...
14248,i gotta' get a grip!
14249,the stupid things are standin'
14250,knee-deep in their dip!
14251,i swear on this here farm
14252,"there's every barnyard species,"
14253,and each and every one of them
14254,is makin' tons of feces.
14255,i'm tired of smellin' livestock.
14256,i'd like to take a nap.
14257,but i can't sleep 'cause i dream of
14258,hogs wallowin' in their crap.
14259,now my wife is in the kitchen
14260,"cookin' soup du jour,"
14261,but nothin' smells real good to me;
14262,i'm surrounded by manure.
14263,my five kitty cats
14264,"buster, sparkle, newbie, speedy"
14265,"and then there’s pixie our smallest kitty,"
14266,"one, two, three and four and five,"
14267,"they’re so frisky, so alive."
14268,"sparkle is my number one,"
14269,14 years old and so much fun.
14270,"purrs and snuggles on my shoulder,"
14271,she‘s getting slow and somewhat older.
14272,"she meows for water from the sink,"
14273,"i turn it on, for her to drink."
14274,"speedy is my number two,"
14275,"proud and handsome, i tell you!"
14276,"he prances like a little pony,"
14277,and you know what? that’s no baloney.
14278,"he guards the others from above,"
14279,and sometimes gives a little shove.
14280,"newbie is my number three,"
14281,"chubby, plump as one can be."
14282,"always cleaning, always licking, "
14283,he tries to run but his paws keep sticking.
14284,"he keeps on searching for a hand,"
14285,to scratch under his collar band.
14286,"buster is my number four,"
14287,"always eating, more and more."
14288,"loves to snack on lots of munchies,"
14289,tender vittles and some crunchies.
14290,"begging, pleading, day and nights."
14291,"""give me crunchies, or i’ll bite!"""
14292,green is so important
14293,because we see it all around
14294,it’s up very high on the trees
14295,and on the grass that is on the ground
14296,green is the colour of
14297,the plants that grow in the south
14298,it’s also the colour of a brussels sprout
14299,that i refuse to put in my mouth
14300,green is on the traffic light
14301,when the cars can go
14302,all the green disappears
14303,when it starts to snow
14304,the most important thing about the colour green
14305,is because of my mother
14306,no she is not green
14307,it’s her favourite colour
14308,i marvel my pencil.
14309,"my special, long, wooden utensil."
14310,i just can't keep my hands from it.
14311,"i got him from a friend, and we've been inseparable since."
14312,"i admit, i forgot to give him back."
14313,"however regrets, i do lack."
14314,"he scribbles my words, when i can't find what to say."
14315,"he makes my thoughts audible, and in a neat and clear way."
14316,"if i make any mistakes, he's always got my back."
14317,"on the end of his long orange body, there's a pink square that's always keeping me on track."
14318,"though he's marked with the number 2, he'll always be number 1 in my book."
14319,i will never over-accessorize him or cause any damage to his look.
14320,"pens, markers, crayons: they just don't cut it for me."
14321,"my perfectly sharpened buddy, is all that i need!"
14322,the ballad of the turkey
14323,as i walked along the road one day
14324,"kicking up stones along the way,"
14325,i saw a bird of unusual size
14326,"who had a large beak and small, beady eyes."
14327,he strutted about and ruffled his wings
14328,then he did the most ominous thing.
14329,he let out a screech and puffed out his chest
14330,i wanted to run from this evil pest.
14331,as this bird's mighty exterior did appear
14332,the inside of my chest was filled with fear.
14333,"he put one talon forward, the other one next"
14334,this troublesome bird was making me vexed.
14335,i then did something that was a great chance.
14336,i kicked a stone at him to stop his advance.
14337,"he then chased the stone, oh joy of great joys!"
14338,i felt myself one of the luckiest boys!
14339,"around the corner i ran, straight to my home,"
14340,leaving that bird confused and alone.
14341,don't befriend a turkey (for that's what he was)
14342,or he will attack you simply because.
14343,lady gagas dress
14344,i was at home watching tv
14345,flicking the channels what could i see
14346,lady gaga got an award and as she got out of her seat
14347,i was amazed she was wearing a dress made of meat
14348,i thought if its good for gaga its good for me
14349,i was down the butchers by half past three
14350,stood at the counter clothes round my feet
14351,i said have you something to fit me that's stylish and neat
14352,he held up a chipolata cheeky sod
14353,hey this is what i was gifted from god
14354,well i got pork chops for pants and rump for a hat
14355,turkey trousers and a sausage cravat
14356,when he was finished i minced down the street
14357,walking on kidneys made for my feet
14358,but soon in the heat i started to foam
14359,then i walked passed the stray dog home
14360,well there was chaos i tried to run
14361,as german sheppard pulled the steak from my bum
14362,a sausage dog grabbed my sausage a basset my chops
14363,it was such chaos i emptied the shops
14364,so my friends if a meat dress your tempted to make
14365,take it from me its a big big mis- steak.
14366,i can not write a poem; my brain feels fried.
14367,it can do no more.
14368,"it is as though all my creativity has been trapped, isolated in a room without a door."
14369,"i fell no inspiration, no ideas are coming to mind."
14370,and as i hold this pen in my hands i can form no words on the lines. 
14371,when i think i'm finally on to something it quickly leaves my brain.
14372,leaving me frustrated and thinking this is all in vain. 
14373,so i'm sorry if you wanted to hear a poem that surprised or shocked
14374,"but i just can't give you one, for i have writer's block!"
14375,the horse ride
14376,"taking a romantic ride today,"
14377,we sat upon the wagon.
14378,suddenly the horse lifted his tail
14379,and we heard a roaring dragon!
14380,the deafening sound hurt my ears
14381,and the smell burned the hairs in my nose.
14382,my girlfriend sat and glared at me.
14383,somehow my fault i suppose.
14384,"it was my idea to take the ride,"
14385,but how was i to know?
14386,it really wasn’t in my plans;
14387,didn’t know the horse would blow.
14388,"the noise and the smell were bad enough,"
14389,as the wind blew quickly by.
14390,"but i think the very worst of it,"
14391,was the brown stuff in my eye.
14392,my girlfriend’s face turned angry red.
14393,"so i figured i wouldn’t dare,"
14394,advise her of the smelly pieces
14395,of horse stuff in her hair.
14396,"the horse finally stopped; my girl ran away,"
14397,stubbornly lifting her chin.
14398,"i think that horse was enjoying himself,"
14399,cause i’m sure i saw him grin. 
14400,a lesson learned for me today.
14401,"although i must confess,"
14402,i laughed so hard i nearly cried
14403,as i wiped away the mess.
14404,the day i remember
14405,i opened my eyes 
14406,i looked to the sky
14407,the birds were singing and whistling by
14408,my heart got thirst to fly
14409,i stretched my hands
14410,and put on my band
14411,i got out of the bed
14412,and forced myself to go ahead
14413,i walked out of my room
14414,and saw a hand with a broom
14415,when i looked up
14416,i asked my mother what's up!
14417,my mother was in anger
14418,in the other hand she took a hanger
14419,my mother was like in battle
14420,and played with me like a shuttle
14421,it was the month of november
14422,which i always remember.:)
14423,a night with my lady
14424,her body glistens in the light
14425,i urge to play with her all night
14426,i pick her up and hold her steady
14427,"take a deep breath, we both are ready."
14428,i run one hand up her long neck
14429,just touching her makes me euphoric
14430,"across her body, my right hand goes"
14431,"i've been practicing, believe me, it shows."
14432,her body glistens in the light
14433,i urge to play with her all night
14434,i pick her up and hold her steady
14435,"take a deep breath, we both are ready."
14436,"another deep breath, the tension mounts"
14437,"have to stay focused, every moment counts"
14438,i am ready lets get movin'
14439,"here it goes, we both start groovin'."
14440,her body glistens in the light
14441,i urge to play with her all night
14442,i pick her up and hold her steady
14443,"take a deep breath, we both are ready."
14444,i start out slow to get in the swing
14445,as i do she starts to sing
14446,the sounds and feelings grow more immense
14447,"the movements, become more intense."
14448,her body glistens in the light
14449,i urge to play with her all night
14450,i pick her up and hold her steady
14451,"take a deep breath, we both are ready."
14452,"she screams and screams, while i am gropin'"
14453,my heart stops as i see the door open
14454,my mom walks in and with a frown
14455,"says, your guitar is too loud, please turn it down."
14456,pet port a potty
14457,i took a walk in the city today
14458,to try to pass the time away.
14459,saw lots of people walking too
14460,stepped right in a pile of doggy doo.
14461,i thought for a moment just what could be done
14462,to clean up the streets of doggie dung.
14463,maybe i'll invent something really super
14464,even finer than a pooper scooper.
14465,a port a potty for our four legged friends
14466,on every street corner where every road bends.
14467,then i'll become famous for this awesome invention
14468,at the monthly town meetings my name will be mentioned.
14469,they'll throw a big party and dance in the streets
14470,because never again will there be poop on our feet!
14471,after the operation
14472,"so now he has had his eyes done, "
14473,"and at last he can see,"
14474,"but i was a bit worried, "
14475,what would he think of me?
14476,"you see, he hadn't seen me, "
14477,"out of two good eyes,"
14478,"would i be a total shock, "
14479,or a nice surprise?
14480,"he said ""my god, you are almost grey, "
14481,"you're eyes are much too small,"
14482,"you are old and fat and ugly,"
14483,"i'm not impressed at all"""
14484,"but as i sat there crying, "
14485,i suddenly noticed that---
14486,"he wasn't looking my way,"
14487,but talking to the cat!!
14488,so yes i think he's very pleased 
14489,with all that he can see
14490,"he thinks every thing is lovely, "
14491,and that includes me!!
14492,smarter than him
14493,i locked my brother in a closet
14494,t’see what he would do.
14495,"and jus' before i think he lost it,"
14496,he thoughta something new:
14497,"“ha-ha!” he said—i thought, “oh, dear”—"
14498,"“you know, i think i got it!"
14499,"i’m not locked insida here,"
14500,"i locked you outta the closet!"""
14501,"“nuh-uh!” i said; he disagreed,"
14502,so i opened the door on a whim
14503,"to prove, before he made me bleed,"
14504,that i was smarta than him
14505,"she stood there by the ocean,"
14506,the breeze gently lifted her hair.
14507,"of that seagull just above her,"
14508,she was totally unaware.
14509,"seemingly floating in the sky,"
14510,the seagull’s wings were still.
14511,"i think it paused to take good aim,"
14512,and drop a mess at will.
14513,"too late she looked above her head,"
14514,where the seagull hovered now.
14515,"then as i watched in horror,"
14516,bird droppings hit her brow.
14517,her scream pierced the balmy air.
14518,splat! the stuff hit her face.
14519,"then she saw my camera and me,"
14520,and stomped off in disgrace.
14521,monkey in the middle
14522,"there once was a monkey in a city’s zoo,"
14523,who dreamed of the outside sun.
14524,"he did like hitting kids with poo,"
14525,but he felt that that’s been done.
14526,"so he climbed out in the middle of night, "
14527,and explored through the cities streets.
14528,he stopped when it was turning light 
14529,and felt he wanted to eat.
14530,that poor monkey needed cash 
14531,to afford his exotic meals.
14532,"but his stomach led him to the trash,"
14533,where he ate a cube of butter and apple peels.
14534,"if he wanted to eat, he needed a job,"
14535,to pay for the food on his tummy.
14536,"so he asked many snobs,"
14537,but each time he left without money.
14538,"he tried to be an actor,"
14539,but found out he couldn't sing or cry.
14540,"he had the smarts to be a politician,"
14541,but found out he couldn't lie.
14542,none one wanted his application.
14543,no one gave him a chance.
14544,some were scared because he was from another nation.
14545,other because he didn’t own pants.
14546,"he only found one job, "
14547,that paid food and shelter instead of wages.
14548,"all he was asked to do,"
14549,"was to sit inside steel cages,"
14550,and dream of the outside sun.
14551,i saw a little bird today 
14552,sitting perched next to my bed
14553,she was singing such a pretty song
14554,i was thinking in my head
14555,so i sat and listened for a while
14556,calm as can be and quite still
14557,till she flew away and perched 
14558,up on my sill
14559,she continued singing a different song
14560,louder than before
14561,curiously i watched her 
14562,and started to get bored
14563,i thought to myself i am tired still
14564,and want to go to bed
14565,so i took my pillow sleepily 
14566,and covered up my head
14567,i waited a while and removed the pillow till
14568,i saw she was still perched on my window sill
14569,i started to turn red
14570,i got up to slam the window closed
14571,and turned to go to bed 
14572,when i saw what i had done 
14573,the little bird was dead
14574,where there was triumph and happiness 
14575,guilt was replaced instead 
14576,for in my eagerness to go to sleep 
14577,i crushed her little head
14578,a dieter's despair
14579,"oh my soul, be thou quiet"
14580,this is not 'another diet'
14581,just a program of exchange
14582,though some things do seem strange
14583,raw vegetables and 'brock-o-lee'
14584,does not sound too good to me
14585,lots of tofu and bean sprouts
14586,while my empty stomach shouts
14587,the meaning here is quite plain;
14588,this program is designed for pain
14589,someone with anorexia planned
14590,a program that tastes like sand
14591,"my hands are sweating, my soul is dreading"
14592,i must keep this thing from spreading
14593,"my only hope, the paper shredder"
14594,it finally made this diet better
14595,the greatest accessory of them all
14596,people care to much.
14597,how their hair looks
14598,or their clothes.
14599,they don't care about what matters
14600,the soul is what truly matters
14601,that thing that is deep inside.
14602,the soul is always fashionable 
14603,no matter what the season is.
14604,the soul is something that changes color a million times
14605,from when you are born to when you die.
14606,my soul is yellow today 
14607,because i'm happy inside.
14608,on thursday my soul was green
14609,for i envied another girl.
14610,the soul is by far the best accessory you can have.
14611,and that's what they should write in the magazines.
14612,what a life!
14613,i once applied for a life online
14614,"sadly however, i was declined"
14615,they told me i was not eligible
14616,so i wrote them a letter to complain
14617,"they sent it back, it was not legible"
14618,so on with my search for a life
14619,this has given me a bit of strife
14620,i don't have enough money or any good looks
14621,i can't paint a picture or write a book
14622,i can barley chew gum and walk at the same time
14623,i can even be quiet enough to become a mime
14624,i once asked a professor where to find one
14625,he directed me straight to an insane asylum
14626,i can't play the drums or even a fife
14627,"i guess i'll have to re-apply, what a life!"
14628,a boy named sue
14629,"well, my daddy left home when i was three,"
14630,"and he didn't leave much to ma and me,"
14631,just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
14632,"now i don't blame him because he run and hid,"
14633,but the meanest thing that he ever did was
14634,before he left he went and named me sue.
14635,"well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,"
14636,"and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,"
14637,it seems i had to fight my whole life through.
14638,some gal would giggle and i'd get red
14639,"and some guy would laugh and i'd bust his head,"
14640,"i tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named sue."
14641,"well, i grew up quick and i grew up mean."
14642,my fist got hard and my wits got keen.
14643,"roamed from town to town to hide my shame,"
14644,"but i made me a vow to the moon and the stars,"
14645,i'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
14646,that man that gave me that awful name.
14647,but it was gatlinburg in mid july and i had
14648,just hit town and my throat was dry.
14649,i'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
14650,at an old saloon in a street of mud
14651,"and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,"
14652,mangy dog that named me sue.
14653,"well, i knew that snake was my own sweet dad"
14654,from a worn-out picture that my mother had
14655,and i knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
14656,he was big and bent and gray and old
14657,"and i looked at him and my blood ran cold,"
14658,"and i said, ""my name is sue. how do you do?"
14659,"now you're gonna die."" yeah, that's what i told him."
14660,"well, i hit him right between the eyes and he went down"
14661,but to my surprise he came up with a knife
14662,and cut off a piece of my ear. but i busted a chair
14663,right across his teeth. and we crashed through
14664,the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
14665,in the mud and the blood and the beer.
14666,i tell you i've fought tougher men but i really can't remember when.
14667,he kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
14668,"i heard him laughin' and then i heard him cussin',"
14669,he went for his gun and i pulled mine first.
14670,he stood there looking at me and i saw him smile.
14671,"and he said, ""son, this world is rough and if"
14672,"a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough"
14673,and i knew i wouldn't be there to help you along.
14674,so i gave you that name and i said 'goodbye'.
14675,i knew you'd have to get tough or die. and it's
14676,"that name that helped to make you strong."""
14677,"yeah, he said, ""now you have just fought one"
14678,"helluva fight, and i know you hate me and you've"
14679,got the right to kill me now and i wouldn't blame you
14680,if you do. but you ought to thank me
14681,before i die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
14682,"in your eye because i'm the guy that named you sue."""
14683,"yeah, what could i do? what could i do?"
14684,"i got all choked up and i threw down my gun,"
14685,"called him pa and he called me a son,"
14686,and i came away with a different point of view
14687,and i think about him now and then.
14688,"every time i tried, every time i win and if i"
14689,ever have a son i think i am gonna name him
14690,bill or george - anything but sue.
14691,whosever room this is should be ashamed!
14692,his underwear is hanging on the lamp.
14693,"his raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,"
14694,and the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.
14695,"his workbook is wedged in the window,"
14696,his sweater's been thrown on the floor.
14697,"his scarf and one ski are beneath the tv,"
14698,and his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.
14699,"his books are all jammed in the closet,"
14700,his vest has been left in the hall.
14701,"a lizard named ed is asleep in his bed,"
14702,and his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.
14703,whosever room this is should be ashamed!
14704,donald or robert or willie or--
14705,"huh? you say it's mine? oh, dear,"
14706,i knew it looked familiar!
14707,tyger! tyger! burning bright
14708,"in the forests of the night,"
14709,what immortal hand or eye
14710,could frame thy fearful symmetry?
14711,in what distant deeps or skies
14712,burnt the fire of thine eyes?
14713,on what wings dare he aspire?
14714,what the hand dare seize the fire?
14715,"and what shoulder, and what art,"
14716,could twist the sinews of thy heart?
14717,"and when thy heart began to beat,"
14718,what dread hand? and what dread feet?
14719,what the hammer? what the chain?
14720,in what furnace was thy brain?
14721,what the anvil? what dread grasp
14722,dare its deadly terrors clasp?
14723,"when the stars threw down their spears,"
14724,"and watered heaven with their tears,"
14725,did he smile his work to see?
14726,did he who made the lamb make thee?
14727,tyger! tyger! burning bright
14728,"in the forests of the night,"
14729,"what immortal hand or eye,"
14730,dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
14731,'twas the night before christmas 
14732,"'twas the night before christmas, when all through the house"
14733,"not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;"
14734,"the stockings were hung by the chimney with care,"
14735,in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there;
14736,the children were nestled all snug in their beds;
14737,while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
14738,"and mamma in her 'kerchief, and i in my cap,"
14739,"had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,"
14740,"when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,"
14741,i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
14742,"away to the window i flew like a flash,"
14743,tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
14744,"the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,"
14745,"gave a lustre of midday to objects below,"
14746,"when what to my wondering eyes did appear,"
14747,"but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,"
14748,"with a little old driver so lively and quick,"
14749,i knew in a moment he must be st. nick.
14750,"more rapid than eagles his coursers they came,"
14751,"and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:"
14752,"""now, dasher! now, dancer! now prancer and vixen!"
14753,"on, comet! on, cupid! on, donder and blixen!"
14754,to the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
14755,"now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"""
14756,"as leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,"
14757,"when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;"
14758,so up to the housetop the coursers they flew
14759,"with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas too—"
14760,"and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof"
14761,the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
14762,"as i drew in my head, and was turning around,"
14763,down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound.
14764,"he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,"
14765,and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
14766,"a bundle of toys he had flung on his back,"
14767,and he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
14768,"his eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!"
14769,"his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!"
14770,"his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,"
14771,and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
14772,"the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,"
14773,"and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;"
14774,he had a broad face and a little round belly
14775,"that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."
14776,"he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,"
14777,"and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself;"
14778,a wink of his eye and a twist of his head
14779,soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread;
14780,"he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,"
14781,"and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,"
14782,"and laying his finger aside of his nose,"
14783,"and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;"
14784,"he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,"
14785,and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
14786,"but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—"
14787,"“happy christmas to all, and to all a good night!”"
14788,"i lay here to night in a dark silent room, "
14789,feeling only pain and uncontrollable gloom.
14790,"pictures of the blood flash in my head, "
14791,pictures of you laying on the floor dead.
14792,"never to come back and mess up my life,"
14793,i smile as i wipe your blood from my knife.
14794,"your darkened red blood spills out on the street,"
14795,"your colden heart stop dead in its beat,"
14796,"i think back to all the pain and the hurt,"
14797,as i cover your body and spit on the dirt.
14798,"from you or you game i can no longer run,"
14799,and me killing you was my turn for fun.
14800,"oh how they'll cry and oh how they'll weep,"
14801,but i know their sorrow is only skin deep.
14802,"as i turn to walk down the cold empty street, "
14803,i walk to the rhythm your heart used to beat.
14804,i think back to you lying dead on the floor 
14805,and smile knowing your heart beats no more!!!!!!!!
14806,prisioner of life
14807,sitting alone in the dark corner.
14808,"knees against my chest, head in my hands."
14809,watching the tears run from eye to floor.
14810,"happiness left my soul, now so dark and cold."
14811,life in my eye is no longer shown.
14812,if only i could escape these chains and cuffs
14813,and once again run from my thoughts.
14814,i am a prisoner of life.
14815,contaminated by this strife.
14816,with death hanging by my side
14817,black tears were all i cried.
14818,anger was builtup in my blood
14819,all the revenge is creating a flood.
14820,these chains will one day break.
14821,you is all i will seek.
14822,like a snake i will slither.
14823,once you sleep i will smother.
14824,"look at me now, try to read my heart"
14825,all my love and joy is forever departed.
14826,you shouldn't have locked me away.
14827,to think i was once your little girl.
14828,"this is what you made me, sick and angry."
14829,i am a prisoner of life.
14830,contaminated by this strife.
14831,with death hanging by my side
14832,black tears were all i cried.
14833,"anger was built in my blood,"
14834,this is what you made me.
14835,your fast asleep in your bed.
14836,your words echoing in my head.
14837,this is my soul being unleashed.
14838,"in my pocket i reached,"
14839,grabbed the knife you once tried
14840,"but unlike you, i will not fail."
14841,a sharp pain opened your eyes.
14842,you gave a look of surprise.
14843,look at me now daddy.
14844,aren't you happy?
14845,during your last breath
14846,i grabbed the key.
14847,i am finally free.
14848,"in desperation i search, trying to find myself i look."
14849,"i search and search, for my heart is lost i search."
14850,too scared to run too scared to move.
14851,paralyzed by pain and fear i search.
14852,i fight to live as i stager at the pain.
14853,i sit beside me staring at what i see. 
14854,i shake my head at what i made me.
14855,i fight to not listen at the pain i created.
14856,the pain i will always see.
14857,as i twitch in emptiness my eyes begin to see.
14858,the more they find the more it hurts.
14859,they look at me as a piece of meat.
14860,"trembling legs, week arms, and scars from defeat."
14861,i fight my self because of what i see.
14862,it's me i'm looking at and me that won’t succeed.
14863,"i stare and look, searching for answers, for that i concede. "
14864,i shred my self and my sole with my eyes.
14865,they are too strong for me for that i am paralyzed.
14866,i see my hands as the grasper of pain. 
14867,they are the retriever of all i have received from me.
14868,as my hands fight back i see.
14869,"i am only what i want to be, and i still have a chance to defeat me."
14870,you better be ready for me.....
14871,"hey you! yeah, i'm talking to you, ""dad""!"
14872,where were you when i needed you the most in my life?
14873,"you were never at my side,"
14874,you just wanted a carefree life.
14875,where were you when i was growing up?
14876,"you were busy starting over, "
14877,drinking from your golden cup.
14878,"did you pretend that i don't exist anymore,"
14879,as you were finding someone new?
14880,"well, i hope you cherish everyday you live,"
14881,because i'm coming for you.
14882,"never at a birthday nor graduation,"
14883,"you didn't care for me, that's clear."
14884,"i hope you have a good story for this,"
14885,because it's one i'm dying to hear.
14886,my father is my enemy
14887,"if this is who you really are, than i want you far..."
14888,"if this is what a father is, than i never want one..."
14889,"you abandon me in my time of need,"
14890,left me with nothing to eat...
14891,i had to survive on my own two feet...
14892,"all the money you had, and still you treated me so bad..."
14893,"you're the worst dad, and that makes you so glad!!!"
14894,what comes around goes right around...
14895,"i hate when you yell, i hate that sound!!!"
14896,i looked for you and hell is what i found!
14897,i should of been your princess with a crown
14898,"instead, you treated me like i was your clown.."
14899,betrayed me and left me with a frown!!
14900,"look at my tears, what about my fears?"
14901,"you can't help me anymore, don't even try, what for?"
14902,i hate what you have done to me!
14903,"i use to be so weak, i was afraid to ever speak..."
14904,now i have found strength and i'm not afraid...
14905,i'm not afraid of telling you to leave. 
14906,"you are my dad just by name, because of you i will never be the same..."
14907,you are insane and that's how you will remain.
14908,"my mom is good, she's not the one to blame..."
14909,she had to play your roll as a dad...
14910,"you were never there, she was always so fair..."
14911,"i hate being patient, but i’ve got more of it than anyone else i know"
14912,"i hate having to put my self aside for something else, "
14913,but i care enough to do it
14914,i find myself filled with a lot of that lately... this… hate… 
14915,it sounds so weird to say it out loud… hate…. it doesn’t have a nice feeling.
14916,i hate- 
14917,it’s just not me.
14918,it’s not how i want to be. 
14919,it doesn’t sound right coming out of my mouth. 
14920,it doesn’t sound right swirling through my head
14921,why is it that i find myself constantly forcing that word out of my head.
14922,i hate that…
14923,"there it is again,"
14924,lately it creeps up on me.
14925,i know what causes it. i’m tired. 
14926,i’m tired of being patient and putting myself second
14927,second for you
14928,i hate you
14929,i don’t hate you. 
14930,i hate the power you seem to have over me
14931,i hate that i can’t hate you.
14932,"i feel helpless, "
14933,the words echo through my head. they echo through the room.
14934,i hate this room.
14935,the room you so kindly took the time to build for me. 
14936,the room in my head.
14937,once my sanctuary. – now my enemy.
14938,i hate this room.
14939,i’m forced to sit in this damp windowless room. 
14940,there is no way out. not yet anyways. 
14941,i have to wait.
14942,wait - and be patient.
14943,i hate what you did to me 
14944,i hate what you took from me 
14945,i hate that it took all these years to get back a broken me
14946,do you know what you did to me not only physically but mentally
14947,do you know how this set me back spiritually 
14948,i can't count the men i've been with
14949,all because of the confusion i was left with
14950,"mom too busy working, selling drugs, then finally doing drugs "
14951,"dad with girls and then in jail who was i left with, who was i to tell"
14952,"but this is no surprise to you, you were there you knew this too"
14953,each and every one of you
14954,but for now all i can say is i hope i get to see you all on judgment day...
14955,not far away
14956,"long ago, when a white man saw his brothers dark face"
14957,he did not accept him because he was from a different race
14958,how could such a horrible thing be so true?
14959,"the scares, the bruises, all black and blue"
14960,where was the love?
14961,"the, finally, a man was sent from an angel above"
14962,no more war
14963,he opened up for us a brand new door
14964,a door where there was no more violence
14965,where we could live everyday in peaceful silence
14966,a door where we the right to choose were we wanted to sit on a bus
14967,and not make a fuss
14968,"so, here we are today"
14969,each year getting more grey
14970,do we accept people the way they are?
14971,"we still have a while to go, but we are not very far"
14972,hate is a word used often in our house
14973,we hate every person 
14974,we dance when we leave 
14975,and beg not to stay
14976,hate is a word to describe everyday
14977,tears shed everyday 
14978,laughter a forgotten sound
14979,love is a word never ever found
14980,as my heart explodes with hate
14981,i cannot but cogitate
14982,"your eyes, your voice, your soul divide"
14983,could lead my to suicide
14984,i hate you more than jews hate hitler
14985,i hate you my childhood hitter
14986,this anger fills me to the top
14987,this shaking will it ever stop?
14988,if you were but a sheet of paper
14989,i might kill you with my stapler
14990,but your not and woe betide
14991,i am not fit for parricide
14992,life moves way too fast
14993,you're the reason i get up to face each hectic day
14994,how did our lives get so consumed with nonsense on the way
14995,we used to take the time to laugh and play a game or two
14996,but now it seems we fight a lot and cry way too much too
14997,so when you go to sleep at night i'll slip in by your side
14998,i'll hold you close and squeeze you tight and feel amazing pride
14999,"you're the one that i love best, it's very clear to see"
15000,with every day i know i'm blessed that you're a part of me
15001,now let's just try to slow it down and savor all that's past
15002,"for that's what molds our future, and life moves way too fast"
15003,a lovers dance
15004,a lovers dance is patient and kind
15005,"it feeds your heart, soul and mind"
15006,it brings you joy and happiness within
15007,knowing that he or she will be with you
15008,through thick and thin.
15009,a lovers dance can be recaptured
15010,only if the partners heart has not been
15011,a lovers dance has no mistakes
15012,it plays no one not even games.
15013,a lovers dance is slow and kind
15014,easy to learn but hard to find.
15015,a lovers dance.
15016,a moment of truth
15017,"my dear love, i wanted to share"
15018,"my thoughts, my feelings and"
15019,what makes me despair
15020,i want to share with you
15021,what makes me happy; what makes me feel blue..
15022,so you can sense that my love is honest and true.
15023,every day not a single minute
15024,passes by without you in it 
15025,"your skin, your voice, your body and your touch"
15026,"all of these moments, i miss them so much."
15027,"you are so present, so deep in my heart"
15028,"and our souls, i just know, will never part,"
15029,but circumstance and distance can be so overwhelming
15030,they close doors and create doubt and we start blaming..
15031,there are actions of mine and i know that for sure..
15032,"that feel so wrong, though my intentions are pure"
15033,they are painful and impossible to bear
15034,and you feel it's all so unfair.
15035,you can't run from yourself;
15036,there is no place to hide
15037,it just hurts you so deep
15038,it hurts your heart and your pride.
15039,then i worry that if i continue to stay
15040,will it be wrong and will i be in your way?
15041,i fear that i am not at all what you need
15042,and that this truth will make my heart break and bleed.
15043,then i sit here and wipe away my tears
15044,wishing you could kiss away my fears
15045,if only you knew how much€¦.
15046,i miss and need your embrace and your touch
15047,i know i can't hide from my thoughts and my fear
15048,and i know at these times i don't seem near
15049,but you break down these walls
15050,with the strength of your love
15051,and then i feel blessed
15052,from god above!
15053,my love for you runs so deep through my vein
15054,"that i dream of you, in spite of the pain."
15055,what i love about you
15056,"the sparkle in your eye,"
15057,the warmth of your skin.
15058,"your breath on my neck,"
15059,that shakes me within.
15060,"the touch of your hand,"
15061,the smell of your hair.
15062,"the naughtiness in your smile,"
15063,that strength in your stare.
15064,"your kiss on my lips,"
15065,your body near mine.
15066,"the stroke of your touch,"
15067,that feeling inside.
15068,the compassion in your embrace.
15069,the power in your face.
15070,the beating of your heart.
15071,that we may never part
15072,"the beauty of your kiss,"
15073,and that magic in your touch.
15074,"it is for all these reasons and more,"
15075,why i love you so much………..
15076,there's no obscurity
15077,"as i gaze into his liquid gold eyes,"
15078,poetry radiates from his warm soul
15079,his lips brush mine and i soar through the skies
15080,passion seizes me; i loose my control
15081,an amalgam of thoughts pierce through my mind
15082,"there is love, trust, yet i feel petrified"
15083,i know destiny; our fate’s intertwined
15084,"but what if he’s a dream, one i’m denied?"
15085,a thousand years i could spend with those suns
15086,amid his presence i’ve conquered all realms
15087,i’ve witnessed beauty that forever stuns
15088,and have basked beneath his forest of elms
15089,"then and there, i grasp truth with clarity"
15090,he’s in my arms; there’s no obscurity
15091,"i crawl in bed and lay my head upon my pillow, with thought’s of the day falling away"
15092,"behind my eye’s your face comes to me with love, i can see your trust for me in your eye’s"
15093,i reach out my hand to you as you turn to leave me. i touch your hand you stop i move to face you to see your soul
15094,"as i come to your face only for you to turn away again what are you hiding from, let me see, you tell me that you're worthy of love, you're not free in your heart, you don’t know how to give your heart away"
15095,"pain keep’s you scared afraid to be open, fear has you frozen, i place my hand’s along your face bring you down to my eye’s look deep within your window’s to your soul"
15096,"i see your fear there holding tight to you, i place my lip’s to yours and breathe your air in, in return i breathe mine into you, with one deep breath your wall’s fall and a new feeling is replaced,"
15097,"love is now within you i close my eye’s and kiss you good bye, you ask me to stay why must you go you say, i say i have gifted you, my love is now yours keep it safe, share it, love like never before, share the gift we are all giving, "
15098,"i turn from you and walk away with joy in my heart, my love for you now is never ending, you will always carry me within your soul, even though i have never been with you."
15099,what a glorious day 
15100,when our souls intertwined and our hearts danced together.
15101,when you flowed in me and a flower blossomed inside.
15102,when a heart began to beat
15103,life awoke from sleep all because of us.
15104,our blood joined and formed a third party
15105,like a supernatural show of illusion.
15106,slowly a human was formed 
15107,"inside of another, implanted by yet another."
15108,"we amaze me, he amazes me!"
15109,you helped me achieve what none can do alone.
15110,i gave you a piece of you and you a piece of me.
15111,the amazing transformation 
15112,from inside to the world was just overwhelming.
15113,i wish you were there.
15114,just the fact that our baby 
15115,"a living, breathing creature of god "
15116,came and looked at the world for the first time.
15117,"he took his first gasp of air, made his first sound."
15118,we created life together.
15119,a bond was built forever in that instant
15120,that you touched so deep and implanted yourself.
15121,every time i look at him i see you 
15122,i see me 
15123,i see yesterday 
15124,i see today 
15125,i see tomorrow 
15126,i see eternity.
15127,i feel joy 
15128,i feel love 
15129,i feel loss 
15130,i feel pride 
15131,i feel wisdom 
15132,i feel strength 
15133,i feel stability 
15134,i feel real.
15135,"i love us so much, for together, we created our first son"
15136,your beauty is unspeakable.
15137,your love is inescapable. 
15138,and i have fallen deep for you.
15139,"the heavens twilight stars,"
15140,"lit up the night sky,"
15141,and i saw you through the midnight gloom.
15142,"took away my breath,"
15143,and stopped the bloom of love.
15144,but the radiance that came from you.
15145,"reflected off the snow,"
15146,melted away all my fears.
15147,and dried all my tears.
15148,now i pray to see you again.
15149,"in the chilled wind,"
15150,i smell your perfume. 
15151,my love is only for you.
15152,how long i’ve waited to see your face again.
15153,i wish this wouldn’t end…
15154,"i wish i could send,"
15155,a love letter straight to your heart.
15156,"from me to you, my love is true."
15157,"a vampire, i wait outside my tomb."
15158,to see you again
15159,to be in a lovers sin…
15160,i pray unto the gods.
15161,i pray unto it all.
15162,"so i wont fall,"
15163,far from you…
15164,just please my lover take my heart…

15192,by krina shah 
15193,my true love
15194,i have a feeling
15195,that i can comprehend
15196,in my deepest thoughts your are
15197,more than just a friend.
15198,i wouldn't want to
15199,rush us now
15200,as love we explore
15201,but there's a growing love inside
15202,that we just can't ignore.
15203,i love the times we
15204,spend together. we are comfortable
15205,and free. i think of you when we are
15206,alone. i think of you and me.
15207,we have a share
15208,secrets to uncover. there’s more
15209,to life then we will both discover.
15210,i love you always.
15211,"i’ll love you when you're dumb,"
15212,"i’ll love you when you're smart,"
15213,"i’ll love you anyway you are,"
15214,right from the start.
15215,i’ll love you if you're tall
15216,"i’ll love you if you're short,"
15217,"i’ll love you if you're pretty,"
15218,or just an ugly dork.
15219,"i’ll love you if you're toothless,"
15220,"i’ll love you if you're blind,"
15221,"anything that's wrong with you,"
15222,to me you'll be fine.
15223,"my heart is opening up now,"
15224,"unlike it used to do,"
15225,i see the pain that's in your heart
15226,and sometimes i feel it to.
15227,"i’ll love you tomorrow,"
15228,"i’ll love you today,"
15229,"i’ll love you forever,"
15230,and forever always.
15231,"fires, wine, beach, and time"
15232,crackling fires and glasses of wine
15233,a walk on the beach forgetting the time
15234,this is all nice and things we should do
15235,but these aren't the things that make me love you
15236,fighting for bed sheets and racing for the better car
15237,aiming for my mouth with animal crackers from afar
15238,tipping the canoe and watching lunch float away
15239,these are the special things that make me want to stay
15240,slapping an insect from my arm onto yours
15241,holding everyone up taking pictures on tours
15242,forget about reservations there's a hostel in site
15243,or maybe we'll backpack it and camp for the night
15244,these are the special things that make me love you
15245,"your educated, witty, funny and true"
15246,so next time you kiss me or take me by the hand
15247,i want you to know just where i stand
15248,i don't need fires or glasses of wine 
15249,i don't need beaches to forget about time 
15250,and even though we have done that and more 
15251,"it's your love that makes me stay, it is you i adore"
15252,i love you with all of my heart...
15253,me on the left and you on the right
15254,the way we laid our bodies the start of the night.
15255,my head on two pillows as yours lay on one
15256,tired from the day and all we had done.
15257,"one arm under pillow, the other kept you warm"
15258,i'd pull you in close during thunder and storm.
15259,i still remember the sweet scent of your hair
15260,as we closed our eyes and i held you for prayer.
15261,the rise and fall of breath from your chest
15262,would remind me of that day that god had blessed.
15263,your face would go soft and lips would yawn
15264,you'd fall asleep with the television still on.
15265,middle of the night your house stayed warm
15266,the fan on high was always the norm.
15267,i'd stolen the blanket and kicked down the sheet
15268,the only pillow you had now lay at your feet.
15269,sometimes i'd wake while there you still lay
15270,i'd creep to your bedside and kneel as to pray.
15271,i would lean in close as if to steal a kiss
15272,these moments of affection are the ones that i miss.
15273,i’d sit and watch while you lay there and snore
15274,i’d sometimes fall asleep with my head on the floor.
15275,you always thought you slept without peep
15276,instead of counting them you baa’d like a sheep.
15277,your body lay still ‘cept for the rise and fall 
15278,of your beautiful body that lay there in sprawl.
15279,but the most memorable part of those sleepless nights
15280,"wasn’t the snoring, the prayer or absence of lights-"
15281,it was the way in which your eyes would flicker
15282,beneath lid and lash i would try not to snicker.
15283,to me it was funny to just watch them move
15284,as if they were dancers stepping to groove.
15285,i could only guess what your mind would dream
15286,maybe thoughts of our future and how it would seem.
15287,"would it be an uphill battle, a test for all time?, "
15288,or simply steps in a stairwell that together we’d climb.
15289,most of the mornings you’d wake with a smile
15290,and some you slept in for at least a little while.
15291,but now these memories are just written in line
15292,and filed in a cabinet in the back of my mind.
15293,"memory of you sleeping, snoring, eyes wide shut"
15294,"now my heart beating, bleeding, crimson and cut. "
15295,your eyelids would flutter as your eyes would dance
15296,and i’d pray to god to just give me the chance-
15297,to fix what i'd done and to right the wrong 
15298,of the poor choices that i'd hidden for oh so long.
15299,these are the thoughts i now remember the most
15300,the memories in my heart i still hold so close.
15301,times i sat by your side as night was still grey
15302,all through the morning before dark turned to day.
15303,i’d ask him to bless this love i’d forsaken
15304,taken for granted and stole for the taking.
15305,unfortunately i received a different kind of answer
15306,but you will always remain my eyelid dancer.
15307,treasures we own
15308,"when my hand is wrinkled so,"
15309,it's you that i will still want you know.
15310,as my hair turns silver and gray
15311,remember me as i was yesterday.
15312,"my long red hair blowing in the breeze,"
15313,we loved each other with ease.
15314,"now in the park your hand i hold,"
15315,you keep me warm as it turns cold.
15316,"we sit on a bench and feed the birds,"
15317,not a single word needs to be heard.
15318,"remembrances of years gone by,"
15319,we both smile...we both sigh.
15320,"remembering our first glance,"
15321,and for hours how we danced.
15322,"the flowers you gave to me for no reason,"
15323,"and the little things you did every season,"
15324,made me a believer in true love.
15325,the kind that's been blessed from above.
15326,"our children have grown and left our home,"
15327,all those memories we now own.
15328,"a treasure of love is between two hearts,"
15329,nothing has ever torn them apart.
15330,"our love has stood the test of time,"
15331,we are still together our souls entwined.
15332,"until the day we shall pass from here,"
15333,eternally we are one soul my dear.
15334,"i don't think you will,"
15335,ever fully understand
15336,how you touched my life
15337,and made me who i am.
15338,you are the keeper of my dreams
15339,the man who holds my heart
15340,the one i want to spend my life with.
15341,the one i always stand.
15342,"stand beside through thick and thin,"
15343,through all that life throws our way
15344,knowing that this special love we share
15345,will guide us each and everyday.
15346,i don't think you could ever feel
15347,all the love i have to give
15348,and i'm sure you never realize
15349,you've been my will to live.
15350,every moment we spent together
15351,"has touched our lives, our souls forever"
15352,the things that we shared and learned
15353,is permanent growth that we've earned.
15354,the person that i have grown into today
15355,"did not get there by chance, no way"
15356,i am who i am partly because of you
15357,"and you are you because of me, too"
15358,the changes i see
15359,and what i have learned about me
15360,are a response to how we affected our lives
15361,and what we discover in each others eyes.
15362,it is uncertain if we have to part or one day live together 
15363,"either way, we have touched our lives forever!"
15364,no matter what the future will show
15365,no matter what we are told.
15366,we are connected on such a deep levels
15367,"that no one can remove that, not even the devil."
15368,our feelings might be different a year from now
15369,but you are part of me forever somehow
15370,a part of me will always be you 
15371,and a part of you will always be me. 
15372,"no matter what happens ,that much is certain "
15373,our souls are one until life closes the curtain.
15374,i will love your forever
15375,for worse or for better
15376,you are tattooed in my heart 
15377,and nothing can tear our souls apart.
15378,i will never forget you
15379,for my love is honest and true.
15380,love so pure
15381,its sweet like the nectar
15382,"of the garden flower,"
15383,its soothing like the buzzing
15384,"of a bumble bee,"
15385,its warm like the rays
15386,"of the morning sun,"
15387,its the search of a love so pure 
15388,which keeps me on the run.
15389,"its the pulse in my vein,"
15390,"the thoughts in my brain,"
15391,"in every breath that i take,"
15392,"the smile my lips make,"
15393,"its in the twinkle of my eye,"
15394,till the day i die.
15395,"its the dream in my sleep,"
15396,its springs freshest leaf;
15397,a love so rare like this 
15398,will always be with me for keeps.
15399,"its the warmth of my blood,"
15400,"as my feelings flood,"
15401,"as says my heart's beat,"
15402,its depth touches the ocean's feet.
15403,"even if its heart searing pain,"
15404,"with nothing to gain,"
15405,"i will feel it as the tear on my cheek,"
15406,and without words my soul will speak.
15407,"a feeling so sincere,"
15408,"a bond so strong,"
15409,i know my soul will never guide me wrong.
15410,"i will wait till my last sunset,"
15411,"till my heart slows down with a dull ache,"
15412,"till my eyes are wet,"
15413,"till i meet my soul's mate,"
15414,"yes, i will wait."
15415,when i'm with you
15416,"in your arms, "
15417,i’m in my safe haven.
15418,"with you holding me tight,"
15419,i have no other craving.
15420,"all i need, "
15421,"is that one look,"
15422,"that says you’re always there,"
15423,just like in a fairy-tale book.
15424,"your eyes talk to me, "
15425,as the world stands still.
15426,"my once empty heart,"
15427,now with love does fill.
15428,"your eyes tell me,"
15429,that you'll love me everyday.
15430,"no matter what may come,"
15431,you'll be there to stay.
15432,i tell you everything
15433,and never with a lie.
15434,"all my worldly secrets,"
15435,and everything that once made me cry.
15436,"everything in my past, "
15437,with you i can forget it all.
15438,"i know i can trust you,"
15439,to catch me if i fall.
15440,"if only i could explain,"
15441,how much love i have for you.
15442,"then maybe, just maybe"
15443,you'd feel it too.
15444,i will always be there for you
15445,"i will always be there for you,"
15446,i am your little friend..
15447,"i will always be in love with you,"
15448,all the way till the end..
15449,"i will always care for you, "
15450,i will never leave...
15451,"you are one person,"
15452,i can never deceive
15453,"i shall go off to sleep,"
15454,"much before you think,"
15455,"maybe i’m not with you,"
15456,the next second you blink
15457,"the day, when i'm not with you,"
15458,just close your eyes
15459,"and take my name,"
15460,i promise you dear.
15461,your life will be the same.
15462,"i will love you more and more, "
15463,"with each rising day,"
15464,i will always be there for you
15465,even if we are far away
15466,"love, love, love"
15467,"she laughs when you make mistakes,"
15468,and cries when you ache.
15469,"she tells you silly things,"
15470,and loves it when you sing..
15471,so weird and funny but its true
15472,she could make you smile when you're blue.
15473,"no matter what people say or do,"
15474,she'll always stand beside you
15475,"but the sad part is,"
15476,you never noticed all of these.
15477,"you took her for granted, yes you did"
15478,thought it was ok for she was easy to please.
15479,"no chocolates, not even roses"
15480,"no special dates, never gone to places"
15481,but it's ok for it didn't matter
15482,coz you promised to hold her forever.
15483,"sweet words left unspoken,"
15484,romantic moments never happened.
15485,"but though you never did what's in her dream,"
15486,holding her hand had always been a perfect scene.
15487,i laugh when you make mistakes
15488,and cry when you ache.
15489,i tell you silly things
15490,i love it when you sing.
15491,so weird and funny but it's true
15492,i've fallen so deeply in love with you
15493,and no matter what people say or do
15494,i'll be here forever loving you.
15495,simple gestures of love give me shiver
15496,it's like a promise of love forever
15497,and though were not perfect i wont ask for more
15498,coz you're the only one i've ever dreamt for!!
15499,i love the way you love me
15500,"i love the way you look at me, "
15501,"i love the way you kiss, "
15502,i love the way you have made my life fill with sudden bliss. 
15503,"i love the way i always feel whenever your around,"
15504,i love the way i miss you when ever you leave town. 
15505,"i love the way you make love to me and then roll over and fart, "
15506,i love the way you hold me so near and dear to your heart. 
15507,"i love the way you argue, "
15508,"i love the way you laugh, "
15509,i love the way you sit inside a bubble bath. 
15510,i love the way you love me and one other thing is true 
15511,i more than anything in this world love how i am so in love with you.
15512,dancing under the pale moonlight
15513,we danced a dance to last for a life time.
15514,you held me close and told me you loved me.
15515,"forever, you shall be in my heart, soul and mind "
15516,"i knew you wore the sweetest man, "
15517,"so loving and so kind, to me."
15518,we are meant to be my love and be in love for all times.
15519,"if you wore to come back to me, i would show you how much you mean to me."
15520,oh don't you remember us dancing under that pale moonlight.
15521,every thing was serene and beautiful.
15522,every thing was right.
15523,you wore the one that held my hand and comforted me through the storms.
15524,"you are the sunshine, the wind and rain.."
15525,and wiped away all the sadness and pain.
15526,"once again, you can be all these things to me, if only you return."
15527,please come back
15528,my angel man 
15529,and tell me those words of love into my ear.
15530,"you have nothing to fear, "
15531,as i will always be true to you and want only you.
15532,together we can make the best couple around 
15533,my love for you will never cease.
15534,"so come back, "
15535,i hope and pray that that someday will be today.
15536,take my hand
15537,"please take my hand, come walk with me"
15538,"i will show you the way, and let you see"
15539,how love and happiness will make you feel
15540,and make your life feel so unreal
15541,i will hold you tight
15542,all through the night
15543,and never let you out of my sight
15544,for you belong to me
15545,for all the world to see
15546,"lying in your arms, san francisco awaits"
15547,"so in depth, hold on with all of my might."
15548,"waiting in the rain, a cold winter night."
15549,"inhale, exhale. calm as i am."
15550,hair blowing in the wind.
15551,somebody take my hand.
15552,my eyes they close;
15553,as i breathe in deep
15554,you run through my mind
15555,and my life is complete.
15556,i open my eyes
15557,but you're still not there
15558,no one could take your place.
15559,with you my heart i share
15560,"a cold afternoon, "
15561,hands as cold as ice
15562,thoughts go through my mind
15563,my feelings are concise
15564,lying in your arms
15565,we are the perfect match
15566,the distance is discouraging
15567,yet still i am attached
15568,"sitting by the fire,"
15569,thinking in a distant stare
15570,waiting under streetlights
15571,nobody could compare
15572,when love begins
15573,i always knew that love would come find me someday
15574,but never did i know that it would be you who was headed my way
15575,you caught me off guard and took me by surprise
15576,"but you simply captivated me, the same way you do when i look into your eyes"
15577,it's true that every good and perfect gift is from above
15578,"you were presented to me as a beautifully packaged gift full of humor, talent, intelligence, beauty and love"
15579,"""it isn't finding the perfect person but learning to see an imperfect person perfectly"""
15580,"we all have our flaws but when i view you through my eyes, perfection is all i see"
15581,"from when you laugh to when you're upset, i still love the little things you do"
15582,especially hearing you laugh and seeing your nose wrinkle the same way mine does too
15583,coming into this relationship has been hard at times but we've made it through
15584,"i know as long as we're on this journey together, there's nothing that we can't do."
15585,sometimes i wonder if what we have is too good to be true
15586,too scared to get my heart broken and scared of the thought of losing you
15587,"but in the end, i trust in the author and perfecter of what i believe"
15588,"because what we ask for in him, we in return shall receive"
15589,"""where your treasure is, your heart will be also"" is how the saying goes"
15590,"i may not know what tomorrow may bring, for god is the only one who knows"
15591,the one thing i do know is that you are my one and only
15592,a treasure in my heart that i want to devote my whole life to completely
15593,i know i don't need to prove my feelings to know they're true
15594,"because what i've known in my past, doesn't come close to the experience i've shared with you"
15595,i've had the experience of being in relationships before
15596,"however, this is the first time i've been truly happy... i couldn't ask for anything more"
15597,"it's an honor to know that i am yours, as you are mine"
15598,and i trust god that he'll bring us together in his beautiful time
15599,"for now, i'll be waiting patiently for that day when we'll be together"
15600,"that precious moment in time when i'll say, ""it's you that i want to be with forever"""
15601,"god made everything beautiful, precious and new"
15602,"just as beautiful and precious as the day will be, when i look into your eyes and say, ""i love you"""
15603,heart and mind
15604,"when i met you, my life changed"
15605,don't know when this feeling came
15606,i got out of bed one morning
15607,shocked about this feeling
15608,"it's not right to love you, i know"
15609,but i can't force myself to forget you
15610,you gave color to my life
15611,though i know the time is not right
15612,i told myself to stay away from you
15613,but i can't teach my heart not to love you
15614,this feeling i had for you keeps growing
15615,a reason for me to be afraid of what this could bring
15616,my mind always telling me to let you go
15617,"but my heart is always saying ""i love you"""
15618,this heart really rules my mind
15619,and that is why i can't stop this feeling inside
15620,asking god to help me to decide
15621,which one will i follow heart or mind?
15622,god has purpose to what i feel
15623,for he only knows about what is real
15624,one thing in common between my heart and mind
15625,is that they're both saying what is right
15626,my mind is right and so with my heart
15627,"but one thing is for sure, you are a part of my life."
15628,"feel broken down, my body aches"
15629,my heart it bleeds from past mistakes
15630,"can't stop the tears, they fall like rain"
15631,the words are spinning 'round my brain
15632,so scared and feeling so alone
15633,the coldness fills my every bone
15634,"no food, no sleep, can't think at all"
15635,"each way i turn, another wall"
15636,this darkness haunts my very soul
15637,my world seems dead i've lost control
15638,the only weapon is my pen
15639,depression has moved in again
15640,"depression is running through my head,"
15641,"these thoughts make me think of death, "
15642,"a darkness which blanks my mind,"
15643,"a walk through the graveyard, what can i find?"
15644,"black shadows walk in between the graves,"
15645,how many lives have not been saved?
15646,"six feet under if not more,"
15647,"how i’d like to go down and explore,"
15648,"the feeling of lying in a box,"
15649,"i can’t get out, is it locked?"
15650,is it day or is it night? 
15651,are birds singing or have bats taken to flight?
15652,"i know one day this is where i’ll go,"
15653,am i afraid? i don’t think so!
15654,will i be able to explore the feeling of death?
15655,after i’ve taken my last breath?
15656,or will i be a shadow in between the graves?
15657,will i know how many lives have not been saved?
15658,after this life is there another one?
15659,"with a different moon and a different sun,"
15660,"i won’t go to hell as i’m already there,"
15661,"a place full of sadness, a place full of despair,"
15662,"so there’s nothing to live for, no future no past,"
15663,"so i might as well end it, end this life at last."
15664,falling from darkness
15665,falling from darkness 
15666,to a place i don't know
15667,everything's moving with no place to go
15668,i feel so alone and scared
15669,"as i fall, i wonder, ""is anyone there?"""
15670,as the days and nights pass right by
15671,i count the nights i just lay and cry
15672,"falling from faith, falling from love"
15673,"please, is there anyone up above?"
15674,"never did i want to feel like this,"
15675,when the answer lies with the slit of the wrist
15676,my mind is racing to find another solution
15677,before it's too late and i'm just an illusion.
15678,no one knows how i really feel
15679,i just want him to hold me and help me heal
15680,"as i fall, i feel the rain"
15681,i begin to think that may be he isn't the key to ease my pain.
15682,echoes of goodbye
15683,endless footsteps lead on along the ground
15684,the grieving people that were here cannot be found
15685,the black clouds come and hide the crying sky
15686,"amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye"
15687,"a young man lived here with a wife, a child, a song"
15688,"life he had, but somewhere something went wrong"
15689,"a mistake--and he left a mourning crowd,"
15690,"left them in a dark, black, and shadowed shroud"
15691,they buried my daddy that day in the rain
15692,and i cried as i held momma's hand
15693,those tears on her face revealed all the pain
15694,we never could quite understand
15695,"at the funeral, they'd said my daddy had been"
15696,"a good man and too young to die,"
15697,and the child i had been asked over again
15698,why hadn't he told me goodbye?
15699,endless footsteps lead on along the ground
15700,the grieving people that were here cannot be found
15701,the black clouds come and hide the crying sky
15702,"amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye"
15703,"stress is eating at me every minute and second of the day, how do i cope with the horrible effects and make it go away?"
15704,"i feel so tired and run down and i don't sleep, i lie in bed at night and wonder why it runs so deep."
15705,"everyone asks why do you look so sad, do i tell them that my stress is eating me up and that i feel really bad?"
15706,"does everyone notice how i walk around in a daze, and that i have deep black bags under my eyes nowadays."
15707,"i wake up every morning feeling so hopeless, like nothing ever goes right and wondering why my life has to be such a mess."
15708,"stress is my one worst enemy, it’s taken over my mind and my whole life in every single degree."
15709,the girl i used to be
15710,"i tell myself that everything's going to be ok,"
15711,that there is no reason for all this pain.
15712,"the time it took to change, the time it took to"
15713,see all those mistakes.
15714,"the life i had, i can't have back. the choices i made,"
15715,affected me in all those ways.
15716,the mistakes i made have not been forgotten.
15717,"the tears i shed, the sounds i made, the feelings "
15718,that left me feeling in a different way.
15719,yet i can't see why these tears feel so unreal.
15720,"i'm not the same, my words are unsaid."
15721,"what i hide, is buried deep inside."
15722,"to know, to love, to breathe."
15723,it hurts to know that i'll never be the
15724,"girl i used to be. the one that would always laugh,"
15725,the one that you knew would always be strong.
15726,"the feeling is real, the truth is sealed."
15727,"i cry in the dark, cuz i know i cut too deep."
15728,"the blood is like the rain, "
15729,in every way it drifts away.
15730,"the scars are real, but the wounds in the heart"
15731,are another mark.
15732,"if you only knew what i've been through,"
15733,or maybe you could take a walk in my shoes.
15734,"i'm not fake, i'm not a doll,"
15735,i just don't think i'm the same in any way.
15736,so where did my soul go?
15737,why did i ever let it runaway?
15738,what happened to that girl?
15739,"the one that could make you laugh,"
15740,the one that would always take you out?
15741,"what happened to that girl, "
15742,cuz i'm lost without her?
15743,"i'm no longer me, the mistakes changed me,"
15744,but did they change her? 
15745,if only i would know.
15746,it's hard to describe how i feel right now
15747,i want to explain it but i don't know how
15748,i can't believe its come to this
15749,"it's our world, not just his"
15750,no matter how hard we try
15751,the man can never hear us cry
15752,we could scream and yell
15753,but he is in his heaven while we're in our hell
15754,the little boy wants his acceptance
15755,but the man keeps his distance
15756,"the little boy has so many ""whys?"""
15757,but the man won't open his eyes
15758,the little girl just wants her dad
15759,but the man doesn't understand
15760,the little girl just wants to be kissed and hugged
15761,but all the man does is shrug
15762,the woman just wants him
15763,but the light is getting dim
15764,she loves him with all her heart
15765,but the man keeps tearing it apart
15766,no matter how hard we try
15767,he can never hear us cry
15768,we could scream and yell
15769,but he is in his heaven while we're in our hell
15770,i want to know one more thing
15771,with my last bit of strength
15772,is this it? is this the end?
15773,"so many tears shed in the dark of night,"
15774,hidden away in our private thoughts
15775,only to be shelved with morning's first light
15776,because of no courage to speak of the pain
15777,this part of our lives remain the same...
15778,"mother's and fathers, sisters and brothers"
15779,gather for holidays they hope will heal
15780,while gathered together sharing a meal
15781,"what they bring, back from the past,"
15782,"perhaps they'll be able to bed it, at last."
15783,"years of analysis, a lifetime of good,"
15784,"can be shattered with just one word,"
15785,"maybe a look, or gesture of scorn;"
15786,"any of which destroys years of progress,"
15787,"all the good overturned,"
15788,"at least that's what i'm told,"
15789,over and over again...
15790,"i sit by a letter, addressed to my sister,"
15791,"no courage to post it, no guts to muster."
15792,i've written the things i needed to say;
15793,will she get my meaning or stray away?
15794,into her own thoughts to calm her that day...
15795,"thoughts of comfort, truth not portrayed."
15796,"it must be nice to be the favored child of choice,"
15797,"to not know the feelings of a life not rejoiced,"
15798,"to know through life, whatever wrong you've done"
15799,"in the eyes of the parents, you'll remain number one;"
15800,to not know what it's like to give of your soul
15801,"for recognition that you will never, ever know..."
15802,stuck in the past
15803,"stuck in the past,"
15804,"old memories, old actions, old regrets,"
15805,"it seems someone never forgets,"
15806,"they seem to return over and over again,"
15807,"when will they disappear, "
15808,when when when...
15809,"why are the details so important,"
15810,"they aren't even related to us,"
15811,"do they really have to add up,"
15812,or have to be continuous?
15813,"feels like being stuck in the past,"
15814,"am curious to how long it will last,"
15815,"it eats away the present o so fast,"
15816,that even our future will become the past.
15817,"three years ago my papa died, "
15818,i remember all the tears i cried.
15819,"i remember the times of basketball, "
15820,"eating ice cream, cookies, and all."
15821,"he went through so much pain, "
15822,i don’t think i could do the same.
15823,"staying alive through the years, "
15824,never letting me see his tears.
15825,"i was writing him lots of letters, "
15826,hoping it would make him better.
15827,"although it made me sad, "
15828,when he went to a better place it made me glad.
15829,"every time he gave me a hug,"
15830,he made me feel snug as a rug.
15831,"he died before my sister was born, "
15832,it is very hard not to mourn.
15833,"i remember how we use to talk, "
15834,making me laugh when my mom he mocked.
15835,"i talk to him everyday, "
15836,never running out of things to say.
15837,"i look up in the sky, "
15838,remembering of when i didn’t want to say goodbye.
15839,"forever i know we will never part, "
15840,because he is always in my heart.
15841,different as black and white
15842,i dont understand
15843,why cant you see
15844,just what your yelling is doing to me
15845,open your eyes
15846,take a look
15847,you used to read me like a book
15848,but times have changed as they tend
15849,and my life is turning into a zoo
15850,tears fall hard
15851,my head starts to pound
15852,and all at once my heart hits the
15853,i dont know what i did to make you
15854,think i cant do anything right
15855,for lately it seems our hearts and
15856,our dreams are as different as black
15857,people say imp perfect
15858,but they don’t know that behind the grades
15859,my life crumbles before my eyes
15860,no one knows who i truly am
15861,well i’ll tell you who i am
15862,i’m a girl who wants to be wild and crazy like a normal kid
15863,but can’t because i’m expected to be a perfect little girl 
15864,to live up to my perfect cousin
15865,but i’m not her 
15866,and i don’t want to be her
15867,i’m a girl that has been picked on
15868,and called so many names 
15869,that i’ve started to believe it
15870,i remember when i used to be an outgoing girl
15871,but now i hide in my shell
15872,afraid of what people might think
15873,my life is messed up behind the perfect show
15874,and no one knows it
15875,people in my family even try to hide it
15876,but they raised a smart girl
15877,and i know everything
15878,for now i’ll keep playing the perfect child
15879,but soon enough 
15880,my outer shell is going to crack
15881,and they better be prepared for what emerges
15882,what conflicts i’ll cause
15883,what family disagreements will occur
15884,because even i don’t know...
15885,how dare you!
15886,how dare you do this to me.
15887,how dare you stand there and let us be.
15888,you not wanting this marriage and working late is how this began.
15889,i now know this has to end.
15890,i have a responsibility to be strong and be there for our boys.
15891,they are human they are not toys.
15892,they want-they need their dad
15893,instead of wishing and being sad.
15894,how dare you do this to me and i go on and let this be.
15895,how dare you stay married to be all these years
15896,and stand back and watch my tears.
15897,i know you don't want me and i know this much is true
15898,i am stronger now instead of being blue.
15899,to tell you the truth i don't care anymore
15900,your lies and you i no longer stand for or adore.
15901,you stole my heart-my pride-my soul
15902,you are not a human you are just cold.
15903,you don't love me or want to be married -i don't know how many times i have to be told
15904,but i realize now you were being you just bitter and cold.
15905,how dare you do this to me and stand there and let this be.
15906,do you feel pain or are you just mad
15907,for once in your cold life i want you to feel sad.
15908,payback is hell and that is what you deserve and i hope you will feel pain and unwanted everyday in everyway.
15909,how dare you do this to me-i have to let go and i now know this is how it has to be. 
15910,i will eventually need to pack up and leave. 
15911,when we say our goodbyes
15912,i will be drying my eyes.
15913,how dare you wanting to leave
15914,i just have to realize we were never meant to be.
15915,mom will you sit down 
15916,to listen what i have to say 
15917,we can be in the same room
15918,and be miles and miles away
15919,we are not a happy family anymore
15920,do you think you fix this
15921,you can’t be
15922,cause you are never home
15923,do you still remember my face
15924,do you think a father figure will help
15925,it won’t i already have one
15926,i don’t want another
15927,you can marry a million guys
15928,we still won’t be a happy family
15929,do you notice i’m slipping away
15930,do you notice the scars on my arms
15931,i’m going crazy stuff just so you will notice me
15932,but the thing is i just want my mom back
15933,i want my best friend
15934,i just want to go back 
15935,where i told you everything
15936,is that possible
15937,all the tears i’ve cried
15938,i just want my mom back!
15939,"a smile is just a gesture,"
15940,"that's made on one's face,"
15941,"what if the knew,"
15942,all i needed was space?
15943,"i need to breathe,"
15944,"need to get away,"
15945,"don't know how much longer,"
15946,i am here to stay.
15947,"we had such fun,"
15948,used to laugh all day.
15949,"you said you wouldn't leave,"
15950,you said you would stay.
15951,"but know you are gone,"
15952,"and i must force a smile,"
15953,"because you had told me,"
15954,it was just for a while.
15955,"now we are leaving,"
15956,leaving all our pasts here.
15957,"ditching the friends and the family,"
15958,that have grown so dear.
15959,"you tell me to be happy,"
15960,"to have fun for a while,"
15961,"but how can i have fun,"
15962,when i can't find a smile?
15963,i guess it didn't
15964,i know i should 
15965,i wish i could
15966,just let you know 
15967,what must not show 
15968,another life 
15969,that is filled with strife
15970,i said no
15971,but i guess what i meant did't really show
15972,he drugged me 
15973,then hugged me
15974,and after that he stripped me of my dignity
15975,and stripped me of my confidence
15976,i know i should
15977,i wish i could
15978,just let you know 
15979,what must not show 
15980,that is filled with strife
15981,i said no 
15982,but i guess what i meant didn't really show
15983,that when a girl says no
15984,she really means no
15985,"the ghost that hunts, but hasn't died."
15986,he left after only a short time.
15987,never wrote or so i thought.
15988,years pass and something tore him a part.
15989,i've always thought something wasn't right.
15990,she tells me my father isn't who i love.
15991,my little mind only cries.
15992,my little mind only hates.
15993,he left and never saw all the wondrous things that i've done.
15994,"the ghost that hunts, but never died."
15995,i haven't heard a word in a long time.
15996,"i'm sweet sixteen, but without the sweetness."
15997,"for the past eight or nine years on my birthdays before i blow out the candles, i wish for his presence to join the room."
15998,or maybe later to see him in a dream.
15999,i pray constantly for god to bring him back to me.
16000,i see my friends with both their mommy's and daddy's.
16001,i wonder maybe that could be me.
16002,jealously isn't a pretty thing and i wish not to be.
16003,"i tell them love for what you have, because the someone unfortunately doesn’t have a dad."
16004,"the ghost that haunts, but still lives."
16005,will you help me find my dad!
16006,not letting you go
16007,grip my hand
16008,"don’t ever let go,"
16009,just give me one more chance
16010,"to let you know,"
16011,i didn’t mean what i said
16012,"and i never thought you’d be here,"
16013,"in an hospital bed,"
16014,"lying cold, numb, almost dead,"
16015,"and i can't take it,"
16016,"please pull through i know you can make it,"
16017,don’t leave me here
16018,make me shed this tear
16019,"you’re all i’ve got,"
16020,"even if i appreciated it or not,"
16021,"you’ve always been there,"
16022,"near or far apart,"
16023,"even though i didn’t realize,"
16024,"you were in my heart,"
16025,and i know you’re strong
16026,"and to this fate you don’t belong,"
16027,"i need you here to comfort me,"
16028,"i need to you to fight,"
16029,"don’t shut your eyes,"
16030,"don’t fall into the light,"
16031,"because if you go, my world will fall apart,"
16032,"and i’ll have a broken heart,"
16033,"and now as you lie here i know,"
16034,"i’ve always needed you,"
16035,"right from the very start,"
16036,and i’m not letting you go.
16037,the pain shows
16038,"when i look into your eyes, "
16039,i see the pain you try to hide.
16040,"you try to be tough, "
16041,but the pain shows 
16042,"the hurting, "
16043,and the suffering that this is causing you
16044,the pain shows
16045,"although you act as if nothing is wrong, "
16046,the pain shows
16047,you try to be brave
16048,but the pain shows
16049,you try to hide the tears
16050,but the pain shows
16051,who knew looking into your eyes would reveal so much pain
16052,does my daddy love me?
16053,does my daddy love me when he doesn't talk to me?
16054,does my daddy love me when he doesn’t spend time with me?
16055,does my daddy love me when he doesn't make me feel special?
16056,does my daddy love me when he doesn’t call me see how i'm doing?
16057,does my daddy love me when he hasn't been to my birthday in 7 years?
16058,dose my daddy love me? 
16059,"really? if so, how come he doesn't show it?"
16060,i'm a sad fairy
16061,she is very beautiful 
16062,one of a kind
16063,she's normal and simple
16064,but she's hard to find
16065,she holds her anger in
16066,but she dreams of fantasy's
16067,she commits many sin's
16068,but seeks a true destiny
16069,she has beautiful long brown hair
16070,she lets it down at night
16071,she's in the starry sky and everywhere
16072,her presents makes light
16073,i see her in the mirror
16074,but in her eyes she holds fear
16075,"alone again, "
16076,just another day dedicated to love ones missed. 
16077,"as i sit with an empty soul, "
16078,"not sad, "
16079,"not glad but pissed, "
16080,thinking back on happier times 
16081,when those who are gone hugged and kissed. 
16082,but they're gone and the world still turns. 
16083,"i put up a bravado that i'm happy, "
16084,but really my heart yearns for those better days 
16085,trips to the beach and sun burns. 
16086,family get-togethers 
16087,laughs and smile. 
16088,food collecting on our plates in piles and piles. 
16089,"but now all that piles up on my tears, "
16090,most out of heartache but some come from fears. 
16091,i could have hydrated an entire nation over the years. 
16092,yet i mask them with smiles that are hollow 
16093,in hope that there will always be a better tomorrow. 
16094,but until then you will forever see is my bravado.
16095,daughter taken by mothers lies
16096,have you any clue ?
16097,to the pain
16098,you have put
16099,me through ?
16100,pain so deep
16101,with in me.
16102,that at night
16103,when i finally
16104,close my eye's
16105,i can hear
16106,we’re far apart
16107,you’ll always be
16108,in our heart
16109,he loved you then
16110,we love you now
16111,kept from your life
16112,we don’t know how
16113,perhaps one day
16114,a chance we’ll be given
16115,until that time
16116,you’ll be missed where we’re liven
16117,we’ll hope for the best
16118,but expect the worst
16119,that you’ll change your mind
16120,for this we’ll thirst
16121,whether you do or don’t
16122,we may never know
16123,but never forget
16124,we still love you so
16125,victim of poverty
16126,poverty stricken youth jus trying to make a buck
16127,mom working two jobs and pops don't give a f**k
16128,daddy never comes around 
16129,at night the only sound
16130,that can be heard are the sounds of the ghetto
16131,"drug dealing, gang banging the sirens of the po po"
16132,he finds himself posted on the corner slangin dope
16133,to him it seems like the only hope
16134,to finally get off the block or stay at a dead end job wit no raise
16135,so on the corner he stays
16136,high school dropout wit no time for class
16137,time at a desk could be spent in the spot making cash
16138,scarface dreams are clouding up his mind
16139,cocaine sales taking up his time
16140,"greed has polluted his brain, spirit, and soul"
16141,hatred and a heart as black as coal
16142,have takin over him what is he to do
16143,no one gives him an answer looking for a clue
16144,looking to the sky for some kind of sign
16145,all he can see is a life full of crime
16146,until the day the cops get him or his enemies catch him in the wrong hood
16147,"wearin the wrong colors, throwin up the wrong signs if he could"
16148,change things he'd do anything for a second chance
16149,times up he has a dance
16150,with the devil that's going to last an eternity
16151,"another soul lost, but others see it as another victim of poverty."
16152,i sit and watch
16153,as the rain falls 
16154,from a sky so dark and gray
16155,is this life
16156,a crying sky
16157,not even i can fight
16158,i'm tired of hurting
16159,i'm tired of tears
16160,i'm tired of being alone
16161,for all these years
16162,i want peace
16163,and i want love
16164,i want to break free
16165,to fly above!
16166,the face of sadness
16167,its happened again.
16168,"the moment when i thought nothing would go wrong,"
16169,"that everything would be alright,"
16170,"that there was nothing to worry about,"
16171,that everything was perfect.
16172,"but just like those other times,"
16173,it didn't last.
16174,"another moment in life,"
16175,another piece to the puzzle.
16176,and showing its face.
16177,the face that i've been longing to see.
16178,"the face i was always aware of,"
16179,"the face i've been waiting for,"
16180,the face i'm conscious of.
16181,suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.
16182,"i stare motionless,"
16183,"although expected, still surprised."
16184,"calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,"
16185,able to realize that this is what i was sent to discover.
16186,sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.
