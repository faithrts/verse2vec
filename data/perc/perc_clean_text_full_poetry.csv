0,"a tree a tree beside the sandy river-beach     holds up its topmost boughs like fingers towards the skies they cannot reach,     earth-bound, heaven amorous. this is the soul of man. body and brain hungry for earth our heavenly flight detain. "
1,"sri krishna o immense light and thou, o spirit-wide boundless space,whom have you clasped and hid, deathless limbs, gloried face? vainly lie 'space and time, ""void are we, there is none.""vainly strive self and world crying, ""i, i alone."" one is there, self of self, soul of space, fount of time,heart of hearts, mind of minds, he alone sits, sublime.oh, no void absolute self-absorbed, splendid, mute,hands that clasp hold and red lips that kiss blow the flute. all he loves, all he moves, all are his, all are he! many limbs sate his whims, hear his sweet ecstasy.two in one, two who know difference rich in sense,two to clasp, one to be, this his strange mystery."
2,"who in the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest,whose is the hand that has painted the glow?when the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether,who was it roused them and bade them to blow?he is lost in the heart, in the cavern of nature,he is found in the brain where he builds up the thought:in the pattern and bloom of the flowers he is woven,in the luminous net of the stars he is caught.in the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman,in the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl;the hand that sent jupiter spinning through heaven,spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.these are his works and his veils and his shadows;but where is he then? by what name is he known?is he brahma or vishnu? a man or a woman?bodied or bodiless? twin or alone?we have love for a boy who is dark and resplendent,a woman is lord of us, naked and fierce.we have seen him a-muse on the snow of the mountains,we have watched him at work in the heart of the spheres.we will tell the whole world of his ways and his cunning:he has rapture of torture and passion and pain;he delights in our sorrow and drives us to weeping,then lures with his joy and his beauty again.all music is only the sound of his laughter,all beauty the smile of his passionate bliss;our lives are his heart-beats, our rapture the bridal of radha and krishna, our love is their kiss.he is strength that is loud in the blare of the trumpets,and he rides in the car and he strikes in the spears;he slays without stint and is full of compassion;he wars for the world and its ultimate years.in the sweep of the worlds, in the surge of the ages,ineffable, mighty, majestic and pure,beyond the last pinnacle seized by the thinker he is throned in his seats that for ever endure.the master of man and his infinite lover,he is close to our hearts, had we vision to see;we are blind with our pride and the pomp of our passions,we are bound in our thoughts where we hold ourselves free.it is he in the sun who is ageless and deathless,and into the midnight his shadow is thrown;when darkness was blind and engulfed within darkness,he was seated within it immense and alone."
3,"revelation someone leaping from the rocks past me ran with windblown locks like a startled bright surmise visible to mortal eyes, —just a cheek of frightened rose that with sudden beauty glows,just a footstep like the wind and a hurried glance behind,and then nothing, — as a thought escapes the mind ere it is caught.someone of the heavenly rout from behind the veil ran out."
4,"the silver call there is a godhead of unrealised things to which time's splendid gains are hoarded dross;a cry seems near, a rustle of silver wings calling to heavenly joy by earthly loss.all eye has seen and all the ear has heard is a pale illusion by some greater voice and mightier vision; no sweet sound or word,no passion of hues that make the heart rejoice can equal these diviner ecstasies.a mind beyond our mind has sole the ken of those yet unimagined harmonies,the fate and privilege of unborn men.as rain-thrashed mire the marvel of the rose,earth waits that distant marvel to disclose."
5,"surrender o thou of whom i am the instrument,o secret spirit and nature housed in me,let all my mortal being now be blent in thy still glory of divinity.i have given my mind to be dug thy channel mind,i have offered up my will to be thy will :let nothing of myself be left behind in our union mystic and unutterable.my heart shall throb with the world-beats of thy 1ove;my body become thy engine for earth-use;in my nerves and veins thy rapture's streams shall move ;my thoughts shall be hounds of light for thy power to loose.keep only my soul to adore eternally and meet thee in each form and soul of thee."
6,"krishna           at last i find a meaning of soul's birth           into this universe terrible and sweet,     i who have felt the hungry heart of earth         aspiring beyond heaven to krishna's feet.     i have seen the beauty of immortal eyes,        and heard the passion of the lover's flute,     and known a deathless ecstasy's surprise       and sorrow in my heart for ever mute.    nearer apd nearer now the music draws,         life shudders with a strange felicity;    all nature is a wide enamoured pause        hoping her lord to touch, to clasp, to be.    for this one moment lived the ages past;   the world now throbs fulfilled in me at last"
7,"the blue bird i am the bird of god in his blue;divinely high and clear i sing the notes of the sweet and the true for the god's and the seraph's ear.i rise like a fire from the mortal's earth into a griefless sky and drop in the suffering soil of his birth fire-seeds of ecstasy.my pinions soar beyond time and space into unfading light;i bring the bliss of the eternal's face and the boon of the spirit's sight.i measure the worlds with my ruby eyes;i have perched on wisdom's tree thronged with the blossoms of paradise by the streams of eternity.nothing is hid from my burning heart;my mind is shoreless and still;my song is rapture's mystic art,my flight immortal will."
8,"bride of the fire bride of the fire, clasp me now close, -bride of the fire!i have shed the bloom of the earthly rose,i have slain desire.beauty of the light, surround my life, -beauty of the light!i have sacrificed longing and parted from grief,i can bear thy delight.image of ecstasy, thrill and enlace, -image of bliss!i would see only thy marvellous face,feel only thy kiss.voice of infinity, sound in my heart, -call of the one!stamp there thy radiance, never to part,o living sun."
9,"a god's labour i have gathered my dreams in a silver air between the gold and the blue and wrapped them softly and left them there,my jewelled dreams of you.i had hoped to build a rainbow bridge marrying the soil to the sky and sow in this dancing planet midge the moods of infinity.but too bright were our heavens, too far away,too frail their ethereal stuff;too splendid and sudden our light could not stay;the roots were not deep enough.he who would bring the heavens here must descend himself into clay and the burden of earthly nature bear and tread the dolorous way.coercing my godhead i have come down here on the sordid earth,ignorant, labouring, human grown twixt the gates of death and birth.i have been digging deep and long mid a horror of filth and mire a bed for the golden river’s song,a home for the deathless fire.i have laboured and suffered in matter’s night to bring the fire to man;but the hate of hell and human spite are my meed since the world began."
10,"musa spiritus o word concealed in the upper fire,thou who hast lingered through centuries,descend from thy rapt white desire,plunging through gold eternities.into the gulfs of our nature leap,voice of the spaces, call of the light!break the seals of matter's sleep,break the trance of the unseen height.in the uncertain glow of human mind,its waste of unharmonied thronging thoughts,carve thy epic mountain-lined crowded with deep prophetic grots.let thy hue-winged lyrics hover like birds over the swirl of the heart's sea.touch into sight with thy fire-words the blind indwelling deity.o muse of the silence, the wideness make in the unplumbed stillness that hears thy voice,in the vast mute heavens of the spirit awake where thy eagles of power flame and rejoice.out, out with the mind and its candles flares,light, light the suns that never die.for my ear the cry of the seraph stars and the forms of the gods for my naked eye!let the little troubled life-god within cast his veils from the still soul,his tiger-stripes of virtue and sin,his clamour and glamour and thole and dole;"
11,"invitation with wind and the weather beating round me     up to the hill and the moorland i go.who will come with me? who will climb with me?wade through the brook and tramp through the snow?not in the petty circle of cities cramped by your doors and your walls i dwell;over me god is blue in the welkin        against me the wind and the storm rebel.i sport with solitude here in my regions,               of misadventure have me a friend.who would live largely?who would live freely?                 here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.i am the lord of tempest and mountain,          i am the spirit of freedom and pride.stark must he be and a kinsman to danger    who shares my kingdom and walks at my side"
12,"the miracle of birth i saw my soul a traveller through time;     from life to life the cosmic ways it trod, obscure in the depths and on the heights sublime,     evolving from the worm into the god. a spark of the eternal fire, it came     to build a house in matter for the unborn. the inconscient sunless night received the flame,     in the brute seed of things dumb and forlorn life stirred and thought outlined a gleaming shape     till on the stark inanimate earth could move, born to somnambulist nature in her sleep     a thinking creature who can hope and love. still by slow steps the miracle goes on, the immortal's gradual birth mid mire and stone. "
13,"because thou art because thou art all-beauty and all-bliss,     my soul blind and enamoured yearns for thee; it bears thy mystic touch in all that is     and thrills with the burden of that ecstasy. behind all eyes i meet thy secret gaze     and in each voice i hear thy magic tune: thy sweetness haunts my heart through nature's ways     nowhere it beats now from thy snare immune. it loves thy body in all living things;     thy joy is there in every leaf and stone: the moments bring thee on their fiery wings;     sight's endless artistry is thou alone. time voyages with thee upon its prow  and all the futures passionate hope is thou"
14,"the inner fields there is a brighter ether than this blue pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,royaler investiture than this massed assault of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.immortal spaces of cerulean hue are in our reach and fields without this fault of drab brown earth and streams that never halt in their deep murmur which white flowers strew floating like stars upon a strip of sky.this world behind is made of truer stuff than the manufactured tissue of earth's grace.there we can walk and see the gods go by and sip from hebe's cup nectar enough to make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face."
15,"the golden light thy golden light came down into my brain and the grey rooms of mind sun-touched became a bright reply to wisdom's occult plane,a calm illumination and a flame.thy golden light came down into my throat,and all my speech is now a tune divine,a paean-song of thee my single note;my words are drunk with the immortal's wine.thy golden light came down into my heart smiting my life with thy eternity;now has it grown a temple where thou art and all its passions point towards only thee.thy golden light came down into my feet,my earth is now thy playfield and thy seat."
16,"evolution (revised)i passed into a lucent still abode and saw as in a mirror crystalline an ancient force ascending serpentine the unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.earth was a cradle for the arriving god and man but a half-dark half-luminous sign of the transition of the veiled divine from matter's sleep and the tormented load of ignorant life and death to the spirit's light.mind liberated swam light's ocean vast,and life escaped from its grey tortured line;i saw matter illumining its parent night.the soul could feel into infinity cast timeless god-bliss the heart incarnadine."
17,"bande mataram mother, i bow to thee!rich with thy hurrying streams,bright with thy orchard gleams,cool with thy winds of delight,dark fields waving, mother of might,mother free.glory of moonlight dreams over thy branches and lordly streams,clad in thy blossoming trees,mother, giver of ease,laughing low and sweet!mother, i kiss thy feet,speaker sweet and low!mother, to thee i bow.who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,when the swords flash out in twice seventy million hands and seventy millions voices roar thy dreadful name from shore to shore?with many strengths who art mighty and stored,to thee i call, mother and lord!thou who savest, arise and save!to her i cry who ever her foemen drave back from plain and sea and shook herself free.thou art wisdom, thou art law,thou our heart, our soul, our breath,thou the love divine, the awe in our hearts that conquers death.thine the strength that nerves the arm,thine the beauty, thine the charm.every image made divine in our temples is but thine.thou art durga, lady and queen,with her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,thou art lakshmi lotus-throned,pure and perfect without peer,mother, lend thine ear.rich with thy hurrying streams,bright with thy orchard gleams,dark of hue, o candid-fair in thy soul, with jewelled hair and thy glorious smile divine,loveliest of all earthly lands,showering wealth from well-stored hands!mother, mother mine!mother sweet, i bow to thee,mother great and free."
18,"the word of the silence a bare impersonal hush is now my mind,a world of sight clear and inimitable,a volume of silence by a godhead signed,a greatness pure, virgin of will.once on its pages ignorance could write in a scribble of intellect the blind guess of time and cast gleam-messages of ephemeral light,a food for souls that wander on nature's rim.but now i listen to a greater word born from the mute unseen omniscient ray:the voice that only silence' ear has heard leaps missioned from an eternal glory of day.all turns from a wideness and unbroken peace to a tumult of joy in a sea of wide release."
19,"the universal incarnation there is a wisdom like a brooding sun,a bliss in the heart's crypt grown fiery white,the heart of a world in which all hearts are one,a silence on the mountains of delight.a calm that cradles fate upon its knees;a wide compassion leans to embrace earth's pain;a witness dwells within our secrecies,the incarnate godhead in the body of man.our mind is a glimmering curtain of that ray,our strength a parody of the immortal's power,our joy a dreamer on the eternal's way hunting the fugitive beauty of an hour.only on the heart's veiled door the word of flame is written, the secret and tremendous name."
20,"the witness spirit i dwell in the spirit's calm nothing can move and watch the actions of thy vast world-force,its mighty wings that through infinity move and the time-gallopings of the deathless horse.this mute stupendous energy that whirls the stars and nebulae in its long train,like a huge serpent through my being curls with its diamond hood of joy and fangs of pain.it rises from the dim inconscient deep upcoiling through the minds and hearts of men,then touches on some height of luminous sleep the bliss and splendour of the eternal plane.all this i bear in me, untouched and still assenting to thy all-wise inscrutable will."
21,"nirvana all is abolished but the mute alone.the mind from thought released, the heart from grief,grow inexistent now beyond belief;there is no i, no nature, known-unknown.the city, a shadow picture without tone,floats, quivers unreal; forms without relief flow, a cinema's vacant shapes; like a reef foundering in shoreless gulfs the world is done.only the illimitable permanent is here. a peace stupendous, featureless, still.replaces all, - what once was i, in it a silent unnamed emptiness content either to fade in the unknowable or thrill with the luminous seas of the infinite."
22,"the call of the impossible our godhead calls us in unrealised things.asleep in the wide fields of destiny,a world guarded by silence' rustling wings sheltered their fine impossibility.but part, but quiver the cerulean gates,close splendours look into our dreaming eyes;we bear proud deities and magnificent fates;faces and hands come near from paradise.what shone thus far above is here in us;bliss unattained our future's birthright is;beauty of our dim soul is amorous,we are the heirs of infinite widenesses.the impossible is the hint of what shall be,mortal the door to immortality."
23,"the dreamboat who was it that came to me in a boat made of dream-fire,with his flame brow and his sun-gold body?melted was the silence into a sweet secret murmur,""do you come now? is the heart's fire ready?""hidden in the recesses of the heart something shuddered,it recalled all that the life's joy cherished,imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,and the boat passed and the gold god vanished.now within the hollowness of the world's breast inhabits - for the love died and the old joy ended - void of a felicity that has fled, gone for ever,and the gold god and the dream boat come not."
24,"cosmic consciousness i have wrapped the wide world in my wider self and time and space my spirit's seeing are.i am the god and demon, ghost and elf,i am the wind's speed and the blazing star.all nature is the nursling of my care,i am its struggle and the eternal rest;the world's joy thrilling runs through me, i bear the sorrow of millions in my lonely breast.i have learned a close identity with all,yet am by nothing bound that i become;carrying in me the universe's call i mount to my imperishable home.i pass beyond time and life on measureless wings,yet still am one with born and unborn things."
25,"the kingdom within there is a kingdom of the spirit's ease.        it is not in this helpless swirl of thought,        foam from the world-sea or spray-whisper caught,with which we build mind's shifting symmetries,nor in life's stuff of passionate unease,        nor the heart's unsure emotions frailty wrought        nor trivial clipped sense-joys soon brought to nought nor in this body's solid transiences.wider behind than the vast universe        our spirit scans the drama and the stir,a peace, a light, an ecstasy, a power waiting at the end of blindness and the curse        that veils it from its ignorant minister,the grandeur of its free eternal hour."
26,"life and death life, death, - death, life; the words have led for ages our thought and consciousness and firmly seemed two opposites; but now long-hidden pages are opened, liberating truths undreamed.life only is, or death is life disguised, -life a short death until by life we are surprised."
27,"bride of the fire bride of the fire, clasp me now close, - bride of the fire!i have shed the bloom of the earthly rose,i have slain desire.beauty of the light, surround my life, - beauty of the light!i have sacrificed longing and parted from grief,i can bear thy delight.image of ecstasy, thrill and enlace, - image of bliss!i would see only thy marvellous face,feel only thy kiss.voice of infinity, sound in my heart, - call of the one!stamp there thy radiance, never to part,o living sun."
28,"ocean oneness silence is round me, wideness ineffable;white birds on the ocean diving and wandering;a soundless sea on a voiceless heaven,azure on azure, is mutely gazing.identified with silence and boundlessness my spirit widens clasping the universe till all that seemed becomes the real,one in a mighty and single vastness.someone broods there nameless and bodiless,conscious and lonely, deathless and infinite,and, sole in a still eternal rapture,gathers all things to his heart for ever."
29,"i have a hundred lives i have a hundred lives before me yet to grasp thee in, o spirit ethereal,be sure i will with heart insatiate pursue thee like a hunter through them all.thou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way and with awakened vision watch me come smiling a little at errors past and lay thy eager hand in mine, its proper home.meanwhile made happy by thy happiness i shall approach thee in things and people dear, and in thy spirit's motions half-possess,loving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,until i lay my hands on thee indeed somewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed."
30,"the unseen infinite arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks i meet no end, for all is boundless he,an absolute joy the wide-winged spirit seeks,a might, a presence, an eternity.in the inconscient dreadful dumb abyss are heard the heart-beats of the infinite.the insensible midnight veils his trance of bliss,a fathomless sealed astonishment of light.in his ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the one:only the eyes of immortality dare to look unblinded on that living sun.yet are our souls the immortal's selves within,comrades and powers and children of the unseen."
31,"life mystic miracle, daughter of delight, life, thou ecstasy,let the radius of thy flight be eternity.on thy wings thou bearest high glory and disdain,godhead and mortality,ecstasy and pain.take me in thy wild embrace without weak reserve body dire and unveiled face;faint not, life, nor swerve.all thy bliss i would explore,all thy tyranny.cruel like the lion's roar,sweet like springtide be.like a titan i would take,like a god enjoy,like a man contend and make,revel like a boy.more i will not ask of thee,nor my fate would choose;king or conquered let me be,live or lose.even in rags i am a god;fallen, i am divine;high i triumph when down-trod,long i live when slain."
32,"god thou who pervadest all the worlds below,yet sitst above,master of all who work and rule and know,servant of love!thou who disdainest not the worm to be nor even the clod,therefore we know by that humility that thou art god."
33,"liberation i have thrown from me the whirling dance of mind and stand now in the spirit's silence free,timeless and deathless beyond creature-kind,the centre of my own eternity.i have escaped and the small self is dead;i am immortal, alone, ineffable;i have gone out from the universe i made,and have grown nameless and immeasurable.my mind is hushed in a wide and endless light,my heart a solitude of delight and peace,my sense unsnared by touch and sound and sight,my body a point in white infinities.i am the one being's sole immobile bliss:no one i am, i who am all that is."
34,"soul in the ignorance soul in the ignorance, wake from its stupor.flake of the world-fire, spark of divinity,lift up thy mind and thy heart into glory.sun in the darkness, recover thy lustre.one, universal, ensphering creation,wheeling no more with inconscient nature,feel thyself god-born, know thyself deathless.timeless return to thy immortal existence."
35,"the godhead i sat behind the dance of danger's hooves in the shouting street that seemed a futurist's whim,and suddenly felt, exceeding nature's grooves,in me, enveloping me the body of him.above my head a mighty head was seen,a face with the calm of immortality and an omnipotent gaze that held the scene in the vast circle of its sovereignty.his hair was mingled with the sun and breeze ;the world was in his heart and he was i:i housed in me the everlasting's peace,the strength of one whose substance cannot die.the moment passed and all was as before;only that deathless memory i bore."
36,"transformation: sonnet my breath runs in a subtle rhythmic stream;it fills my members with a might divine:i have drunk the infinite like a giant’s wine.time is my drama or my pageant dream.now are my illumined cells joy’s flaming scheme and changed my thrilled and branching nerves to fine channels of rapture opal and hyaline for the influx of the unknown and the supreme.i am no more a vassal of flesh,a slave to nature and her leaden rule;i am caught no more in the senses’ narrow mesh.my soul unhorizoned widens to measureless sight,my body is god’s happy living tool,my spirit a vast sun of deathless light."
37,"to weep because to weep because a glorious sun has set which the next morn shall gild the east again;to mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate which by that force a double strength attain;to shrink from pain without whose friendly strife joy could not be, to make a terror of death who smiling beckons us to farther life,and is a bridge for the persistent breath;despair and anguish and the tragic grief of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears as rend the heart, though meant for its relief, and all man's ghastly company of fears are born of folly that believes the span of life the limit of immortal man."
38,"kamadeva when in the heart of the valleys and hid by the roses the sweet love lies,has he wings to rise to his heavens or in the closes lives and dies?on the peaks of the radiant mountains if we should meet him proud and free,will he not frown on the valleys? would it befit him chained to be?will you then speak of the one as a slave and a wanton,the other too bare?but god is the only slave and the only monarch we declare.it is god who is love and a boy and a slave for our passion he was made to serve;it is god who is free and proud and the limitless tyrant our souls deserve."
39,"the guest - sonnet i have discovered my deep deathless being:masked by my front of mind, immense, serene it meets the world with an immortal's seeing,a god-spectator of the human scene.no pain and sorrow of the heart and flesh can tread that pure and voiceless sanctuary.danger and fear, fate's hounds, slipping their leash rend body and nerve, - the timeless spirit is free.awake, god's ray and witness in my breast,in the undying substance of my soul flamelike, inscrutable the almighty guest.death nearer comes and destiny takes her toll;he hears the blows that shatter nature's house:calm sits he, formidable, luminous."
40,"oh lord, what shall i say to you?by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)english version by gunther smith oh lord, what shall i say to you?you have broken my dark slumber,and now i shall move on the path of light.i shall move, i shall move, i shall move.my flower, which was long neglected,you have threaded in your garland.the offerings of my mind,which were soiled with dust,you have taken onto your lap.i exchange all i had, for i have received you.to you alone i will listen.i will listen, i will listen, i will listen."
41,"oh unknown traveler, you come alone by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)english version by gunther smith oh unknown traveler, you come alone.at the end of night when the jasmine flower fell.seeing my door closed, you stood by the wayside.my eyes half closed in sleep, some things i could see, and some things i could not.then you went away at dawn, wet with the mist at the end of night, floating in the infinite void.the jasmine creeper at my door still carries the message of your arrival.removing its drops of dew, it remains awake, ever waiting for you.if at that time, i had opened my door, and whispered a word in your ear that autumn midnight,i would have floated aloft, and mingled myself in your melody."
42,"on the path of the journey to effulgence,by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)english version by gunther smith on the path of the journey to effulgence,all are invited today, hence, i call.the earth, swinging in the great universal swing, has become beautiful.today, there is no discrimination.come all together, forgetting rivalry, let us all jointly announce that we are one and will remain one.all hearts are threaded in the same garland of gems. let us all sing the song in the same tune.there is no high or low, black or white. all are brothers in the world.pain or earnestness of one, is pain or earnestness of all.all hearts oscillate in the same swing, within the ocean of nectar, singing one song.full of love, arousing hope, speaking in the same tone?look ahead.extending love to both friend and foe, singing the song of pardon, let us go forward."
43,"the violin of all human minds by anandamurti (prabhat ranjan sarkar)english version by gunther smith the violin of all human minds is playing with one harmony today, and so is the scent of every heart.with your sweet appearance, you have descended on the earth, giving the same realization.do not break this garland of flowers, which is the entire wealth of my love.come closer and still closer and closer;and take away my everything."
44,"at dusk, at dawn i gaze upon your beauty by darshan singh english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi original language urdu at dusk, at dawn i gaze upon your beauty --a dazzling spectacle of rising moon and sun.so far, the wayfarers have not discovered your footprints:they stand staring at the stepstone of your door your glance of abundant grace did not satisfy;we with the seeing eye know a glance from a glance.saqi, they've just arrived and taken their seats;how is it that they've already gained intimacy?some you inspire with the madness of prostration:they cannot tell their heads from your door.saqi, whoever comes by even a tinge of awakening we see sitting in your assembly, oblivious to this world.men who are maddened by the thought of the goal see not fellow travelers -- they are intent on the road.master, in what strange state your darshan lives:we always see his eyes moist with tears."
45,"how did i ever think silence the language of love?by darshan singh english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi original language urdu how did i ever think silence the language of love?what i thought would not come to light was in plain sight.i hear my silence talked of in every lane;the suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.the beloved's regard was but a flash of light;how innocent to think i'd found eternal bliss.these, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind and that handful of pitiful straws i'd called my nest.darshan, the glances i'd fancied voiced my love --even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing."
46,"how should i tell of the feeling that reigns by darshan singh english version by barry lerner and harbans singh bedi original language urdu how should i tell of the feeling that reigns in the court of the friend?dancing light is my beloved's face, cup and carafe are ecstatic!every nook and cranny is effulgent with his light;every mote and grain celebrates the beloved's face.on earth from end to end i see his beauty,in heaven after heaven i gaze upon my friend.seeker banished from the beatific vision, look through the eyes of your heart!how can you see the beloved's light with eyes of flesh and blood?man's sorrows i bore, this world i loved --my whole life i gave to the work of my friend.brushing past me, it stirred my heart and was gone:god! the morning breeze has learned to tease from my friend.let them try to imprison him in temple, mosque and church!the seeing eye finds the beloved's signs in every mote.very near your heart are seekers of your vision;those who look at the surface are exiled from the beloved's light.what can i say of the grace he showers on me within?darshan, the moment i close my eyes, the beloved's light begins."

117,"another paradise lost one sleepy summer afternoon, while helping myself to a glass of chilled water, i saw a snake lying curled under the fridge. it could have been a very poisonous cobra. very quickly, i chose my mode of attack: acid.staggering, i reached for the glass bottle so that i could pour the yellow-green cheap acid on its slimy body, burning it to death.“stop it”, the snake hissed in pure tamil connecting with me in the language of my prayer and poetry. “i am an exile.”and i configured mental images of political refugees. it wriggled out and i saw that it was balding, almost rushdie-like, perhaps with a death sentence too. controversy was a crowd pulling catch-phrase, to which i dutifully succumbed. acid bottle in hand, i heard the snake preach to me about living in detachment.“the perfection of life is when you do not know the difference between yielding and resisting.” the scrawny being writhed further and told me of rebirth and reincarnation. being a writer i really wanted to take notes. instead i began arguing. “shut up”, the snake said to me,“karma and the whole stuff that follows it is just bunkum. you, a crazed agnostic, disagree because of borrowed ideas.” sharp movements of the red tongue terrified me. almost sensing my fear, it said, “you could never challenge what you do not comprehend.” the snake spoke in circles, in patterns that could only resemble a snake swallowing its tail. whatever. and then it occurred to me: speech was the oldest trap,the charming deceiver, persuasion’s weapon and satan’s first area of expertise. “stop it”,this time i said the words. “tell me just your story. save the cant and rant for critical times.”my acidic tone gained me a menacing status and i continued, “you are a mean serpent.instigator. trouble-maker. sly liar. undulating temptation-provider. unworthy reminder of the seduction of strength over matter.” it protested in a booming resonant voice, “no, i am not any of this. i am just an exile, from paradise. because of your catholic upbringing,you don’t even know about the paradise lost in hinduism.” who bothered for history or heritage, except shriveling snakes and failed writers? at least, we both had something in common. “look here comrade, my credentials are different. in heaven, i was an activist. an avid dissenter. before the accession to heaven,long long ago, i was a mighty monarch on earth,feared and respected. i was nahusa the great.my subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous.and i ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day when i decided that i could take leave of life. in heaven too, i was venerated. but one question had plagued me all the years of my long life, and it still tormented me in heaven. i wanted to know why caste was there, why people suffered because of their karmas. i questioned the gods, and the learned sages there. i asked them what would happen if an high-born did manual work just like the low-born.i worried about the division of labor, this disparity in dreams and destinies. you could say i was a rebel pleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. i had a riotous history of revolution. the gods plotted against me,decided that i was trouble. i was cursed to turn into a vile snake. i was banished from paradise. for sixty million years, i shall roam the earth, and then i may return.” this was a different case of the paradise lost.in this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second fickle-minded woman. tradition triumphed over reason and the good were cast away. i let the serpent go,happy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or perhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. i began to respect snakes — the challengers of hierarchy.while i gave him the freedom of safe passage i vowed never to kill serpents. much later i realized brutally that this was just another occupational hazard for choosing a life where i was to be showing solidarity with activists and dissenters."

168,"leave this leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? open thine eyes and see thy god is not before thee! he is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. he is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! deliverance? where is this deliverance to be found? our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us all for ever. come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! what harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow."

170,"light light, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light, heart-sweetening light! ah, the light dances, my darling, at the center of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth. the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light. the light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion. mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure. the heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad."
171,"little flute thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. this frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. this little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new. at the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable. thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill."
172,"little of me let only that little be left of me whereby i may name thee my all. let only that little be left of my will whereby i may feel thee on every side, and come to thee in everything, and offer to thee my love every moment. let only that little be left of me whereby i may never hide thee. let only that little of my fetters be left whereby i am bound with thy will, and thy purpose is carried out in my life---and that is the fetter of thy love."
173,"lost star when the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first splendor, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang `oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!' but one cried of a sudden ---`it seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost.' the golden string of their harp snapped, their song stopped, and they cried in dismay ---`yes, that lost star was the best, she was the glory of all heavens!' from that day the search is unceasing for her, and the cry goes on from one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy! only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves ---`vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'"
174,"lost time on many an idle day have i grieved over lost time. but it is never lost, my lord. thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands. hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness. i was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. in the morning i woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers."
175,"lotus on the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and i knew it not. my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and i started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion. i knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart."
176,"lover's gifts ii: come to my garden walk come to my garden walk, my love. pass by the fervid flowers that press themselves on your sight. pass them by, stopping at some chance joy, which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines, yet elude.for lover's gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits across the shade, spreading a shiver of joy along the dust.overtake it or miss it for ever. but a gift that can be grasped is merely a frail flower, or a lamp with flame that will flicker."
177,"lover's gifts iv: she is near to my heart she is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs. my love for her is my life flowing in its fullness, like a river in autumn flood, running with serene abandonment. my songs are one with my love, like the murmur of a stream, that sings with all its waves and current."
178,"lover's gifts lii: tired of waiting tired of waiting, you burst your bonds, impatient flowers, before the winter had gone. glimpses of the unseen comer reached your wayside watch, and you rushed out running and panting, impulsive jasmines, troops of riotous roses.you were the first to march to the breach of death, your clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air. you laughed and pressed and pushed each other, bared your breast and dropped in heaps.the summer will come in its time, sailing in the flood-tide of the south wind. but you never counted slow moments to be sure of him. you recklessly spent your all in the road, in the terrible joy of faith.you heard his footsteps from afar, and flung your mantle of death for him to tread upon. your bonds break even before the rescuer is seen, you make him your own ere he can come and claim you."
179,"lover's gifts liv: in the beginning of time in the beginning of time, there rose from the churning of god's dream two women. one is the dancer at the court of paradise, the desired of men, she who laughs and plucks the minds of the wise from their cold meditations and of fools from their emptiness; and scatters them like seeds with careless hands in the extravagant winds of march, in the flowering frenzy of may.the other is the crowned queen of heaven, the mother, throned on the fullness of golden autumn; she who in the harvest-time brings straying hearts to the smile sweet as tears, the beauty deep as the sea of silence, -brings them to the temple of the unknown,at the holy confluence of life and death."
180,"lover's gifts lviii: things throng and laugh things throng and laugh loud in the sky; the sands and dust dance and whirl like children. man's mind is aroused by their shouts; his thoughts long to be the playmates of things.our dreams, drifting in the stream of the vague, stretch their arms to clutch the earth, -their efforts stiffen into bricks and stones, and thus the city of man is built.voices come swarming from the past,-seeking answers from the living moments. beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst for forms. they are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light,to find themselves in things. they will be lured into poets's rhymes, they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet planned, they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the future, they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet to come."
181,"lover's gifts lxx: take back your coins take back your coins, king's councillor. i am of those women you sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never seen a women. i failed in your bidding.dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of sunbeam. we laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine anger.like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning stars. he lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest.never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. the women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. quickly came i to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, i said,""lord, accept my service.""i led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, i dried his feet with my trailing hair. when i raised my face and looked into his eyes, i thought i felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, -blessed am i, blessed is god, who made me a woman. i heard him say to me, ""what god unknown are you? your touch is the touch of the immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight.""ah, no, not that smile, king's councillor, -the dust of worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. but this boy's innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman divine....the women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose they began to pelt him with flowers.alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to cover you in its folds? i fell at his feet and cried, ""forgive me."" i fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as i fled, "" forgive me. "" the women's foul laughter pressed me like a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" what god unknown are you?"""
182,"lover's gifts v: i would ask for still more i would ask for still more, if i had the sky with all its stars,and the world with its endless riches; but i would be content with the smallest corner of this earth if only she were mine."
183,"lover's gifts viii: there is room for you there is room for you. you are alone with your few sheaves of rice.my boat is crowded, it is heavily laden, but how can i turn you away? your young body is slim and swaying; there is a twinkling smile in the edge of your eyes, and your robe is coloured like the rain cloud.the travellers will land for different roads and homes. you will sit for a while on the prow of my boat, and at the journey's end none will keep you back.where do you go, and to what home, to garner your sheaves? i will not question you, but when i fold my sails and moor my boat i shall sit and wonder in the evening, -where do you go, and to what home, to garner your sheaves?"
184,"lover's gifts xiii: last night in the garden last night in the garden i offered you my youth's foaming wine. you lifted the cup to your lips, you shut your eyes and smiled while i raised your veil, unbound your tresses, drawing down upon my breast your face sweet with its silence, last night when the moon's dream overflowed the world of slumber.to-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to god's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of flowers in your hand. i stand aside in the shade under the tree,with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to the temple."
185,"lover's gifts xix: it is written in the book it is written in the book that man, when fifty, must leave the noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. but the poet proclaims that the forest hermitage is only for the young. for it is the birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. there the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty.and alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe discipline of courting."
186,"lover's gifts xl: a message came a message came from my youth of vanished days, saying, "" i wait for you among the quivering of unborn may, where smiles ripen for tears and hours ache with songs unsung.""it says, ""come to me across the worn-out track of age, through the gates of death. for dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered fruits of the year decay, but i am the eternal truth, and you shall meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to shore."""
187,"lover's gifts xlii: are you a mere picture are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as this dust? they throb with the pulse of things, but you are immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form.the day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your limbs singing of life. my world found its speech in your voice, and touched my heart with your face. you suddenly stopped in your walk,in the shadow-side of the forever, and i went on alone.life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it runs; it beckons me on, i follow the unseen; but you stand there,where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a mere picture.no, it cannot be. had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in her cadence of colours. had the glimmering dusk of your hair vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would die with its dreams.can it be true that i forgot you? we haste on without heed,forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. yet they breathe unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. you have moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.you are no longer before my songs, but one with them. you came to me with the first ray of dawn. i lost you with the last gold of evening. ever since i am always finding you through the dark. no,you are no mere picture."
188,"lover's gifts xliii: dying, you have left behind dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the eternal in my life. you have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the earth to love's heaven. clasped in your dear arms, life and death united in me in a marriage bond.i think i can see you watching there in the balcony with your lamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet.my world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding the cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own."
189,"lover's gifts xliv: where is heaven where is heaven? you ask me, my child,-the sages tell us it is beyond the limits of birth and death, unswayed by the rhythm of day and night; it is not of the earth.but your poet knows that its eternal hunger is for time and space, and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust.heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body, my child, in your palpitating heart.the sea is beating its drums in joy, the flowers are a-tiptoe to kiss you. for heaven is born in you, in the arms of the mother-dust."
190,"lover's gifts xlvii: the road is the road is my wedded companion. she speaks to me under my feet all day, she sings to my dreams all night.my meeting with her had no beginning, it begins endlessly at each daybreak, renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs, and her every new kiss is the first kiss to me.the road and i are lovers. i change my dress for her night after night, leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside inns when the day dawns."
191,"lover's gifts xlviii: i travelled the old road i travelled the old road every day, i took my fruits to the market,my cattle to the meadows, i ferried my boat across the stream and all the ways were well known to me.one morning my basket was heavy with wares. men were busy in the fields, the pastures crowded with cattle; the breast of earth heaved with the mirth of ripening rice.suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to kiss me on my forehead. my mind started up like the morning out of mist.i forgot to follow the track. i stepped a few paces from the path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower i had only known in bud.my everyday wisdom was ashamed. i went astray in the fairyland of things. it was the best luck of my life that i lost my path that morning, and found my eternal childhood."
192,"lover's gifts xvi: she dwelt here by the pool she dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins. many an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth had come to her over the young shoots of rice.her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their winter quilts. the water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day after day, on the footpath leading to the village.the women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to greet her.many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom i love."
193,"lover's gifts xviii: your days your days will be full of cares, if you must give me your heart.my house by the cross-roads has its doors open and my mind is absent, -for i sing.i shall never be made to answer for it, if you must give me your heart. if i pledge my word to you in tunes now, and am too much in earnest to keep it when music is silent, you must forgive me; for the law laid down in may is best broken in december.do not always keep remembering it, if you must give me your heart. when your eyes sing with love, and your voice ripples with laughter, my answers to your questions will be wild, and not miserly accurate in facts, -they are to be believed for ever and then forgotten for good."
194,"lover's gifts xxii: i shall gladly suffer i shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,if only in some happy future i am born a herd-boy in the brinda forest.the herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to splash and plunge in the jamuna's cool deep stream.he calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the courtyard to milk the king.as the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds.when the april night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks of the blue river.no, i will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of new bengal; i shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for the benighted. if only i could be born, under the shady asoka groves, in some village of brinda, where milk is churned by the maidens!"
195,"lover's gifts xxviii: i dreamt i dreamt that she sat by my head, tenderly ruffling my hair with her fingers, playing the melody of her touch. i looked at her face and struggled with my tears, till the agony of unspoken words burst my sleep like a bubble.i sat up and saw the glow of the milky way above my window,like a world of silence on fire, and i wondered if at this moment she had a dream that rhymed with mine."
196,"lover's gifts xxxix: there is a looker-on things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore, and those forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves. he has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved, in twilight hours of many a nameless star. therefore his sky seems to ache with the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of ages without beginning."
197,"maya that i should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance ---such is thy maya. thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. this thy self-separation has taken body in me. the poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloued tears and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams break and form. in me is thy own defeat of self. this screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day. behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of straightness. the great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. with the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me."
198,"moment's indulgence i ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. the works that i have in hand i will finish afterwards. away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure"
199,"my friend art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love, my friend? the sky groans like one in despair. i have no sleep tonight. ever and again i open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend! i can see nothing before me. i wonder where lies thy path! by what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?"
200,"my song this song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like the fond arms of love.this song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of blessing.when you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with aloofness.my song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.it will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is over your road.my song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry your sight into the heart of things.and when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in your living heart."
201,"o fool o fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! o beggar, to come beg at thy own door! leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret. thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.it is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. accept only what is offered by sacred love."
202,"ocean of forms i dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless. no more sailing from harbor to harbor with this my weather-beaten boat. the days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves. and now i am eager to die into the deathless. into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the music of toneless strings i shall take this harp of my life. i shall tune it to the notes of forever, and when it has sobbed out its last utterance, lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent."
203,"old and new thou hast made me known to friends whom i knew not. thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. i am uneasy at heart when i have to leave my accustomed shelter; i forget that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest. through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. when one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. oh, grant me my prayer that i may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of many."
204,"on the seashore on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. the infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. on the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances. they build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. with withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. children have their play on the seashore of worlds. they know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. the sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. the sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. on the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children."
205,"only thee that i want thee, only thee---let my heart repeat without end. all desires that distract me, day and night, are false and empty to the core. as the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry ---`i want thee, only thee'. as the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is ---`i want thee, only thee'."
206,"paper boats day by day i float my paper boats one by one down the running stream.in bid black letters i write my name on them and the name of the village where i live.i hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who i am.i load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.i launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.i know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!when night comes i bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.the fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins their baskets full of dreams."
207,"parting words when i go from hence let this be my parting word, that what i have seen is unsurpassable. i have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus am i blessed ---let this be my parting word. in this playhouse of infinite forms i have had my play and here have i caught sight of him that is formless. my whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch; and if the end comes here, let it come ---let this be my parting word."
208,"passing breeze yes, i know, this is nothing but thy love, o beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. the morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart. thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet.patience by rabindranath tagore if thou speakest not i will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. i will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience. the morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky. then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves."
209,"playthings child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning. i smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig. i am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour. perhaps you glance at me and think, ""what a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"" child, i have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies. i seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. with whatever you find you create your glad games, i spend both my time and my strength over things i never can obtain. in my frail canoe i struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that i too am playing a game."
210,"prisoner `prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?' `it was my master,' said the prisoner. `i thought i could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, and i amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. when sleep overcame me i lay upon the bed that was for my lord, and on waking up i found i was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' `prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?' `it was i,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. i thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. thus night and day i worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. when at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, i found that it held me in its grip.'"
211,"purity life of my life, i shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs. i shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind. i shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart. and it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act."
212,"roaming cloud i am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky, o my sun ever-glorious! thy touch has not yet melted my vapor, making me one with thy light, and thus i count months and years separated from thee. if this be thy wish and if this be thy play, then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, paint it with colors, gild it with gold, float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders. and again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, i shall melt and vanish away in the dark, or it may be in a smile of the white morning, in a coolness of purity transparent."
213,"sail away early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and i, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end. in that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words. is the time not come yet? are there works still to do? lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests. who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?"
214,"salutation in one salutation to thee, my god, let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet. like a rain-cloud of july hung low with its burden of unshed showers let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee. let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee. like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their mountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in one salutation to thee."
215,"seashore on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. the infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. on the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances. they build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. with withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. children have their play on the seashore of worlds. they know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. the sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. the sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. on the seashore of endless worlds children meet. tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. on the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children."
216,"senses deliverance is not for me in renunciation. i feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight. thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim. my world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple. no, i will never shut the doors of my senses. the delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight. yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love."
217,"she she who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning light, will be my last gift to thee, my god, folded in my final song. words have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain. i have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life. over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart. many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair. there was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition."
218,"signet of eternity the day was when i did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life. and today when by chance i light upon them and see thy signature, i find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten. thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that i heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star."
219,"silent steps have you not heard his silent steps? he comes, comes, ever comes. every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes. many a song have i sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, `he comes, comes, ever comes.' in the fragrant days of sunny april through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes. in the rainy gloom of july nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes. in sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine."
220,"sit smiling i boasted among men that i had known you. they see your pictures in all works of mine. they come and ask me, `who is he?' i know not how to answer them. i say, `indeed, i cannot tell.' they blame me and they go away in scorn. and you sit there smiling. i put my tales of you into lasting songs. the secret gushes out from my heart. they come and ask me, `tell me all your meanings.' i know not how to answer them. i say, `ah, who knows what they mean!' they smile and go away in utter scorn. and you sit there smiling"
221,"sleep in the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without struggle, resting my trust upon thee. let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship. it is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening.song unsung by rabindranath tagore the song that i came to sing remains unsung to this day. i have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. the time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart. the blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. i have not seen his face, nor have i listened to his voice; only i have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house. the livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and i cannot ask him into my house. i live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet."
222,"still heart when i give up the helm i know that the time has come for thee to take it. what there is to do will be instantly done. vain is this struggle. then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed. these my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them i forget all else again and again. but i shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here."
223,"stream of life the same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. it is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers. it is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow. i feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. and my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment"
224,"strong mercy my desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through. day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire. there are times when i languidly linger and times when i awaken and hurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire."
225,"superior mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!she does not know the difference between the lights in the streets and the stars.when we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real food, and tries to put them into her mouth.when i open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson.when i shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.everybody knows that father is away, but if in play i call aloud ""father,"" she looks about her in excitement and thinks that father is near.when i hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man brings to carry away the clothes and i warn her that i am the schoolmaster, she will scream for no reason and call me dada.your baby wants to catch the moon. she is so funny; she calls ganesh ganush.mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!"
226,"sympathy if i were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would you say ""no"" to me if i tried to eat from your dish?would you drive me off, saying to me, ""get away, you naughty little puppy?""then go, mother, go! i will never come to you when you call me, and never let you feed me any more.if i were only a little green parrot, and not your baby,mother dear, would you keep me chained lest i should fly away?would you shake your finger at me and say, ""what an ungrateful wretch of a bird! it is gnawing at its chain day and night?""the go, mother, go! i will run away into the woods; i will never let you take me in your arms again."
227,"the astronomer i only said, ""when in the evening the round full moon gets entangled among the beaches of that dadam tree, couldn't somebody catch it?""but dada laughed at me and said, ""baby, you are the silliest child i have ever known. the moon is ever so far from us, how could anybody catch it?""i said, ""dada, how foolish you are! when mother looks out of her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far away?""still dada said, ""you are a stupid child! but, baby where could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?""i said, ""surely you could catch it with your hands.""but dada laughed and said, ""you are the silliest child i have known. if it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is.""i said, ""dada, what nonsense they teach at your school! when mother bends her face down to kiss us, does her face look very big?""but still dada says, ""you are a stupid child."""
228,"the banyan tree o you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have nested in your branches and left you?do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?the women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling to wake up.sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles weaving golden tapestry.two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and the child would sit still and think.he longed to be the wind and blow through your resting branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like those ducks among the weeds and shadows."
229,"the beginning ""where have i come from, where did you pick me up?"" the baby asked its mother.she answered, half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to her breast-""you were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.you were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with clay i made the image of my god every morning, i made the unmade you then.you were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship i worshipped you.in all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you have lived.in the lap of the deathless spirit who rules our home you have been nursed for ages.when in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a fragrance about it.your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the sky before the sunrise.heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have stranded on my heart.as i gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all have become mine.for fear of losing you i hold you tight to my breast. what magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of mine?"""
230,"the boat i must launch out my boat. the languid hours pass by on the shore---alas for me! the spring has done its flowering and taken leave. and now with the burden of faded futile flowers i wait and linger. the waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall. what emptiness do you gaze upon! do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the far-away song floating from the other shore?"
231,"the chanpa flower supposing i became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?you would call, ""baby, where are you?"" and i should laugh to myself and keep quite quiet.i should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.when after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it cane from me.when after the midday meal you sat at the window reading ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,i should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,just where you were reading.but would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child?when in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted lamp in your hand i should suddenly drop on to the earth again and be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.""where have you been, you naughty child?""""i won't tell you, mother."" that's what you and i would say then."
232,"the child-angel they clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end to their wrangling.let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence.they are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden knives thirsting for blood.go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my child. at sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the worship of the day."
233,"the end it is time for me to go, mother; i am going.when in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out your arms for your baby in the bed, i shall say, ""baby is not here!""-mother, i am going.i shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and i shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and kiss you again.in the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with the lightning through the open window into your room.if you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the night, i shall sing to you from the stars, ""sleep, mother, sleep.""one the straying moonbeams i shall steal over your bed, and lie upon your bosom while you sleep.i shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your eyelids i shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly i shall flit out into the darkness.when, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children come and play about the house, i shall melt into the music of the flute and throb in your heart all day.dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""where is our baby, sister?"" mother, you will tell her softly, ""he is in the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul."
234,"the first jasmines ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!i seem to remember the first day when i filled my hands with these jasmines, these white jasmines.i have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;i have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the darkness of midnight;autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines that i held in my hands when i was a child.many a glad day has come in my life, and i have laughed with merrymakers on festival nights.on grey mornings of rain i have crooned many an idle song.i have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven by the hand of love.yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh jasmines that filled my hands when i was a child."
235,"the flower-school when storm-clouds rumble in the sky and june showers come down.the moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its bagpipes among the bamboos.then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.mother, i really think the flowers go to school underground.they do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand in a corner.when the rain come they have their holidays.branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars are.haven't you see how eager they are to get there? don't you know why they are in such a hurry?of course, i can guess to whom they raise their arms; they have their mother as i have my own."
236," the further bank i long to go over there to the further bank of the river.where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;where men cross over in their boats in the morning with ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the riverside pasture;whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds.mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman of the ferry when i am grown up.they say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank.where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their eggs;where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the clean soft mud;where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when i am grown up.i shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing.when the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon,i shall come running to you, saying, ""mother, i am hungry.""when the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees,i shall come back in the dust.i shall never go away from you into the town to work like father.mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when i am grown up."
237,"the gardener iv: ah me ah me, why did they build my house by the road to the market town?they moor their laden boats near my trees.they come and go and wander at their will.i sit and watch them; my time wears on.turn them away i cannot. and thus my days pass by.night and day their steps sound by my door.vainly i cry, ""i do not know you.""some of them are known to my fingers, some to my nostrils, the blood in my veins seems to know them, and some are known to my dreams.turn them away i cannot. i call them and say, ""come to my house whoever chooses. yes, come.""in the morning the bell rings in the temple.they come with their baskets in their hands.their feet are rosy red. the early light of dawn is on their faces.turn them away i cannot. i call them and i say, ""come to my garden to gather flowers. come hither.""in the mid-day the gong sounds at the palace gate.i know not why they leave their work and linger near my hedge.the flowers in their hair are pale and faded; the notes are languid in their flutes.turn them away i cannot. i call them and say, ""the shade is cool under my trees. come, friends.""at night the crickets chirp in the woods.who is it that comes slowly to my door and gently knocks?i vaguely see the face, not a word is spoken, the stillness of the sky is all around.turn away my silent guest i cannot. i look at the face through the dark, and hours of dreams pass by."
238,"the gardener ix: when i go alone at night when i go alone at night to my love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind does not stir, the houses on both sides of the street stand silent.it is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and i am ashamed.when i sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle on the trees, and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep.it is my own heart that beats wildly--i do not know how to quiet it.when my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens,the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars.it is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. i do not know how to hide it."
239,the gardener li: then finish the last song then finish the last song and let us leave.forget this night when the night is no more.whom do i try to clasp in my arms? dreams can never be made captive.my eager hands press emptiness to my heart and it bruises my breast.
240,"the gardener lix: o woman o woman, you are not merely the handiwork of god, but also of men;these are ever endowing you with beauty from their hearts.poets are weaving for you a web with threads of golden imagery;painters are giving your form ever new immortality.the sea gives its pearls, the mines their gold, the summer gardens their flowers to deck you, to cover you, to make you more precious.the desire of men's hearts has shed its glory over your youth.you are one half woman and one half dream."
241,"the gardener lv: it was mid-day it was mid-day when you went away .the sun was strong in the sky.i had done my work and sat alone on my balcony when you went away.fitful gusts came winnowing through the smells of may distant fields.the doves cooed tireless in the shade,and a bee strayed in my room hum-ming the news of many distant fields.the village slept in the noonday heat. the road lay deserted.in sudden fits the rustling of the leaves rose and died.i gazed at the sky and wove in the blue the letters of a name i had known,while the village slept in the noonday heat.i had forgotten to braid my hair.the languid breeze played with it upon my cheek.the river ran unruffled under the shady bank.the lazy white clouds did not move.i had forgotten to braid my hair.it was mid-day when you went away.the dust of the road was hot and the fields panting.the doves cooed among the dense leaves.i was alone in my balcony when you went away."
242,"the gardener lxi: peace, my heart peace, my heart, let the time for the parting be sweet.let it not be a death but completeness.let love melt into memory and pain into songs.let the flight through the sky end in the folding of the wings over the nest.let the last touch of your hands be gentle like the flower of the night.stand still, o beautiful end, for a moment, and say your last words in silence.i bow to you and hold up my lamp to light you on your way."
243,"the gardener lxiv: i spent my day i spent my day on the scorching hot dust of the road.now, in the cool of the evening, i knock at the door of the inn. it is deserted and in ruins.a grim ashath tree spreads its hungry clutching roots through the gaping fissures of the walls.days have been when wayfarers came here to wash their weary feet.they spread their mats in the courtyard in the dim light of the early moon, and sat and talked of strange lands.they woke refreshed in the morning when birds made them glad, and friendly flowers nodded their heads at them from the wayside.but no lighted lamp awaited me when i came here.the black smudges of smoke left by many a forgotten evening lamp stare,like blind eyes, from the wall.fireflies flit in the bush near the dried-up pond, and bamboo branches fling their shadows on the grass-grown path.i am the guest of no one at the end of my day.the long night is before me, and i am tired."
244,"the gardener lxix: i hunt for the golden stag i hunt for the golden stag.you may smile, my friends, but i pursue the vision that eludes me.i run across hills and dales, i wander through nameless lands, because i am hunting for the golden stag.you come and buy in the market and go back to your homes laden with goods, but the spell of the homeless winds has touched me i know not when and where.i have no care in my heart; all my belongings i have left far behind me.i run across hills and dales, i wander through nameless lands--because i am hunting for the golden stag."
245,"the gardener lxviii: none lives for ever, brother none lives for ever, brother, and nothing lasts for long. keep that in mind and rejoice.our life is not the one old burden,our path is not the one long journey.one sole poet has not to sing one aged song.the flower fades and dies; but he who wears the flower has not to mourn for it for ever.brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.there must come a full pause to weave perfection into music.life droops toward its sunset to be drowned in the golden shadows.love must be called from its play to drink sorrow and be borne to the heaven of tears.brother, keep that in min and rejoice.we hasten to gather our flowers lest they are plundered by the passing winds.it quickens our blood and brightens our eyes to snatch kisses that would vanish if we delayed.our life is eager, our desires are keen,for time tolls the bell of parting.brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.there is not time for us to clasp a thing and crush it and fling it away to the dust.the hours trip rapidly away, hiding their dreams in their skirts.our life is short; it yields but a few days for love.were it for work and drudgery it would be endlessly long.brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.beauty is sweet to us, because she dances to the same fleeting tune with our lives.knowledge is precious to us, because we shall never have time to complete it.all is done and finished in the eternal heaven.but earth's flowers of illusion are kept eternally fresh by death.brother, keep that in mind and rejoice."
246,"the gardener lxxv: at midnight at midnight the would-be ascetic announced:""this is the time to give up my home and seek for god. ah, who has held me so long in delusion here?""god whispered, ""i,"" but the ears of the man were stopped.with a baby asleep at her breast lay his wife, peacefully sleeping on one side of the bed.the man said, ""who are ye that have fooled me so long?""the voice said again, ""they are god,"" but he heard it not.the baby cried out in its dream,nestling close to its mother.god commanded, ""stop, fool, leave not thy home,"" but still he heard not.god sighed and complained, ""why does my servant wander to seek me,forsaking me?"""
247,"the gardener lxxvi: the fair was on the fair was on before the temple.it had rained from the early morning and the day came to its end.brighter than all the gladness of the crowd was the bright smile of a girl who bought for a farthing a whistle of palm leaf.the shrill joy of that whistle floated above all laughter and noise.an endless throng of people came and jostled together. the road was muddy, the river in flood, the field under water in ceaseless rain.greater than all the troubles of the crowd was a little boy's trouble--he had not a farthing to buy a painted stick.his wistful eyes gazing at the shop made this whole meeting of men so pitiful."
248,"the gardener lxxxi: why do you whisper so faintly why do you whisper so faintly in my ears, o death, my death?when the flowers droop in the evening and cattle come back to their stalls, you stealthily come to my side and speak words that i do not understand.is this how you must woo and win me with the opiate of drowsy murmur and cold kisses, o death, my death?will there be no proud ceremony for our wedding?will you not tie up with a wreath your tawny coiled locks?is there none to carry your banner before you, and will not the night be on fire with your red torch-lights,o death, my death?come with your conch-shells sound-ing, come in the sleepless night.dress me with a crimson mantle,grasp my hand and take me.let your chariot be ready at my door with your horses neighing impatiently.raise my veil and look at my face proudly, o death, my death!"
249,"the gardener lxxxiii: she dwelt on the hillside she dwelt on the hillside by edge of a maize-field, near the spring that flows in laughing rills through the solemn shadows of ancient trees. the women came there to fill their jars,and travellers would sit there to rest and talk. she worked and dreamed daily to the tune of the bubbling stream.one evening the stranger came down from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks were tangled like drowsy snakes. we asked in wonder, ""who are you?""he answered not but sat by the garrulous stream and silently gazed at the hut where she dwelt. our hearts quaked in fear and we came back home when it was night.next morning when the women came to fetch water at the spring by the deodar trees, they found the doors open in her hut, but her voice was gone and where was her smiling face?the empty jar lay on the floor and her lamp had burnt itself out in the corner. no one knew where she had fled to before it was morning--and the stranger had gone.in the month of may the sun grew strong and the snow melted, and we sat by the spring and wept. we wondered in our mind, ""is there a spring in the land where she has gone and where she can fill her vessel in these hot thirsty days?"" and we asked each other in dismay, ""is there a land beyond these hills where we live?""it was a summer night; the breeze blew from the south; and i sat in her deserted room where the lamp stood still unlit. when suddenly from before my eyes the hills vanished like curtains drawn aside. ""ah, it is she who comes. how are you, my child? are you happy? but where can you shelter under this open sky?and, alas! our spring is not here to allay your thirst.""""here is the same sky,"" she said,""only free from the fencing hills,--this is the same stream grown into a river,--the same earth widened into a plain."" ""everything is here,"" i sighed, ""only we are not."" she smiled sadly and said, ""you are in my heart."" i woke up and heard the babbling of the stream and the rustling of the deodars at night."
250,"the gardener lxxxiv: over the green over the green and yellow rice-fields sweep the shadows of the autumn clouds followed by the swift-chasing sun.the bees forget to sip their honey;drunken with light they foolishly hover and hum.the ducks in the islands of the river clamour in joy for mere nothing.let none go back home, brothers,this morning, let none go to work.let us take the blue sky by storm and plunder space as we run.laughter floats in the air like foam on the flood.brothers, let us squander our morning in futile songs."
251,"the gardener x: let your work be, bride let your work be, bride. listen, the guest has come.do you hear, he is gently shaking the chain which fastens the door?see that your anklets make no loud noise, and that your step is not over-hurried at meeting him.let your work be, bride, the guest had come in the evening.no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride,do not be frightened.it is the full moon on a night of april; shadows are pale in the court-yard; the sky overhead is bright.draw your veil over your face if you must, carry the lamp to the door if you fear.no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, do not be frightened.have no word with him if you are shy; stand aside by the door when you meet him.if he asks you questions, and if you wish to, you can lower you eyes in silence.do not let your bracelets jingle when, lamp in hand, you lead him in.have no words with him if your are shy.have you not finished you work yet,bride? listen, the guest has come.have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed?have you not got ready the offering basket for the evening service?have you not put the red lucky mark at the parting of your hair, and done your toilet for the night?o bride, do you hear, the guest has come?let your work be!"
252,"the gardener xiii: i asked nothing i asked nothing, only stood at the edge of the wood behind the tree.languor was still upon the eyes of the dawn, and the dew in the air.the lazy smell of the damp grass hung in the thin mist above the earth.under the banyan tree you were milking the cow with your hands,tender and fresh as butter.and i was standing still.i did not say a word. it was the bird that sang unseen from the thicket.the mango tree was shedding its flowers upon the village road, and the bees came humming one by one.on the side of the pond the gate of shiva's temple was opened and the worshipper had begun his chants.with the vessel on your lap you were milking the cow.i stood with my empty can.i did not come near you.the sky woke with the sound of the gong at the temple.the dust was raised in the road from the hoofs of the driven cattle.with the gurgling pitchers at their hips, women came from the river.your bracelets were jingling, and foam brimming over the jar.the morning wore on and i did not come near you."
253,"the gardener xiv: i was walking by the road i was walking by the road, i do not know why, when the noonday was past and bamboo branches rustled in the wind.the prone shadows with their out-stretched arms clung to the feet of the hurrying light.the koels were weary of their songs.i was walking by the road, i do not know why.the hut by the side of the water is shaded by an overhanging tree.some on was busy with her work,and her bangles made music in the corner.i stood before this hut, i know not why.the narrow winding road crosses many a mustard field, and many a mango forest.it passes by the temple of the village and the market at the river landing-place.i stopped by this hut, i do not know why.years ago it was a day of breezy march when the murmur of the spring was languorous, and mango blossoms were dropping on the dust.the rippling water leapt and licked the brass vessel that stood on the landing-step.i think of that day of breezy march,i do not know why.shadows are deepening and cattle returning to their folds.the light is grey upon the lonely meadows, and the villagers are waiting for the ferry at the bank.i slowly return upon my steps, i do not know why."
254,"the gardener xix: you walked you walked by the riverside path with the full pitcher upon your hip.why did you swiftly turn your face and peep at me through your fluttering veil?that gleaming look from the dark came upon me like a breeze that sends a shiver through the rippling water and sweeps away to the shadowy shore.it came to me like the bird of the evening that hurriedly flies across the lampless room from the one open window to the other, and disappears in the night.you are hidden as a star behind the hills, and i am a passer-by upon the road.but why did you stop for a moment and glance at my face through your veil while you walked by the river-side path with the full pitcher upon your hip?"
255,"the gardener xl: an unbelieving smile an unbelieving smile flits on your eyes when i come to you to take my leave.i have done it so often that you think i will soon return.to tell you the truth i have the same doubt in my mind.for the spring days come again time after time; the full moon takes leave and comes on another visit,the flowers come again and blush upon their branches year after year,and it is likely that i take my leave only to come to you again.but keep the illusion awhile; do not send it away with ungentle haste.when i say i leave you for all time, accept it as true, and let a mist of tears for one moment deepen the dark rim of your eyes.then smile as archly as you like when i come again."
256,"the gardener xlii: o mad, superbly drunk o mad, superbly drunk;if you kick open your doors and play the fool in public;if you empty your bag in a night, and snap your fingers at prudence;if you walk in curious paths and play with useless things;reck not rhyme or reason;if unfurling your sails before the storm you snap the rudder in two,then i will follow you, comrade,and be drunken and go to the dogs.i have wasted my days and nights in the company of steady wise neighbours.much knowing has turned my hair grey, and much watching has made my sight dim.for years i have gathered and heaped up scraps and fragments of things:crush them and dance upon them,and scatter them all to the winds.for i know 'tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go the dogs.let all crooked scruples vanish,let me hopelessly lose my way.let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my anchors.the world is peopled with worthies,and workers, useful and clever.there are men who are easily first,and men who come decently after.let them be happy and prosper, and let me be foolishly futile.for i know 'tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the dogs.i swear to surrender this moment all claims to the ranks of the decent.i let go my pride of learning and judgment of right and of wrong.i'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering the last drop of tears.with the foam of the berry-red wine i will bathe and brighten my laughter.the badge of the civil and staid i'll tear into shreds for the nonce.i'll take the holy vow to be worthless,to be drunken and go to the dogs."
257,"the gardener xliii: no, my friends no, my friends, i shall never be an ascetic, whatever you may say.i shall never be and ascetic if she does not take the vow with me.it is my firm resolve that if i cannot find a shady shelter and a companion for my penance, i shall never turn ascetic.no, my friends, i shall never leave my hearth and home, and retire into the forest solitude, if rings no merry laughter in its echoing shade and if the end of no saffron mantle flutters in the wind; if its silence is not deepened by soft whispers.i shall never be an ascetic."
258,"the gardener xliv: reverend sir, forgive reverend sir, forgive this pair of sinners. spring winds to-day are blowing in wild eddies, driving dust and dead leaves away, and with them your lessons are all lost.do not say, father, that life is a vanity.for we have made truce with death for once, and only for a few fragrant hours we two have been made immortal.even if the king's army came and fiercely fell upon us we should sadly shake our heads and say, brothers,you are disturbing us. if you must have this noisy game, go and clatter your arms elsewhere. since only for a few fleeting moments we have been made immortal.if friendly people came and flocked around us, we should humbly bow to them and say, this extravagant good fortune is an embarrassment to us.room is scarce in the infinite sky where we dwell. for in the spring-time flowers come in crowds, and the busy wings of bees jostle each other.our little heaven, where dwell only we two immortals, is too absurdly narrow."
259,the gardener xlv: to the guests to the guests that must go bid god's speed and brush away all traces of their steps.take to your bosom with a smile what is easy and simple and near.to-day is the festival of phantoms that know not when they die.let your laughter be but a meaning-less mirth like twinkles of light on the ripples.let your life lightly dance on the edges of time like dew on the tip of a leaf.strike in chords from your harp fitful momentary rhythms.
260,"the gardener xlvi: you left me you left me and went on your way.i thought i should mourn for you and set your solitary image in my heart wrought in a golden song.but ah, my evil fortune, time is short.youth wanes year after year; the spring days are fugitive; the frail flowers die for nothing, and the wise man warns me that life is but a dewdrop on the lotus leaf.should i neglect all this to gaze after one who has turned her back on me?that would be rude and foolish,for time is short.then, come, my rainy nights with pattering feet; smile, my golden autumn; come, careless april, scatter-ing your kisses abroad.you come, and you, and you also!my loves, you know we are mortals.is it wise to break one's heart for the one who takes her heart away? for time is short.it is sweet to sit in a corner to muse and write in rhymes that you are all my world.it is heroic to hug one's sorrow and determine not to be consoled.but a fresh face peeps across my door and raise its eyes to my eyes.i cannot but wipe away my tears and change the tune of my song.for time is short."
261,"the gardener xlviii: free me free me from the bonds of your sweetness, my love! nor more of this wine of kisses.this mist of heavy incense stifles my heart.open the doors, make room for the morning light.i am lost in you, wrapped in the folds of your caresses.free me from your spells, and give me back the manhood to offer you my freed heart."
262,"the gardener xvi: hands cling to eyes hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins the record of our hearts.it is the moonlit night of march;the sweet smell of henna is in the air;my flute lies on the earth neglected and your garland of flowers is unfinished.this love between you and me is simple as a song.your veil of the saffron colour makes my eyes drunk.the jasmine wreath that you wove me thrills to my heart like praise.it is a game of giving and with-holding, revealing and screening again;some smiles and some little shyness,and some sweet useless struggles.this love between you and me is simple as a song.no mystery beyond the present;no striving for the impossible; no shadow behind the charm; no groping in the depth of the dark.this love between you and me is simple as a song.we do not stray out of all words into the ever silent; we do not raise our hands to the void for things beyond hope.it is enough what we give and we get.we have not crushed the joy to the utmost to wring from it the wine of pain.this love between you and me is simple as a song."
263,"the gardener xviii: when two sisters when the two sisters go to fetch water, they come to this spot and they smile.they must be aware of somebody who stands behind the trees when-ever they go to fetch water.the two sisters whisper to each other when they pass this spot.they must have guessed the secret of that somebody who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.their pitchers lurch suddenly, and water spills when they reach this spot.they must have found out that somebody's heart is beating who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.the two sisters glance at each other when they come to this spot, and they smile.there is a laughter in their swift-stepping feet, which makes confusion in somebody's mind who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water."
264,"the gardener xx: day after day he comes day after day he comes and goes away.go, and give him a flower from my hair, my friend.if he asks who was it that sent it, i entreat you do not tell him my name--for he only comes and goes away.he sits on the dust under the tree.spread there a seat with flowers and leaves, my friend.his eyes are sad, and they bring sadness to my heart.he does not speak what he has in mind; he only comes and goes away."
265,"the gardener xxi: why did he choose why did he choose to come to my door, the wandering youth, when the day dawned?as i come in and out i pass by him every time, and my eyes are caught by his face.i know not if i should speak to him or keep silent. why did he choose to come to my door?the cloudy nights in july are dark;the sky is soft blue in the autumn; the spring days are restless with the south wind.he weaves his songs with fresh tunes every time.i turn from my work and my eyes fill with the mist. why did he choose to come to my door?"
266,"the gardener xxii: when she passed by me when she passed by me with quick steps, the end of her skirt touched me.from the unknown island of a heart came a sudden warm breath of spring.a flutter of a flitting touch brushed me and vanished in a moment, like a torn flower petal blown in the breeze.it fell upon my heart like a sigh of her body and whisper of her heart."
267,"the gardener xxiv: do not keep to yourself do not keep to yourself the secret of your heart, my friend!say it to me, only to me, in secret.you who smile so gently, softly whisper, my heart will hear it, not my ears.the night is deep, the house is silent, the birds' nests are shrouded with sleep.speak to me through hesitating tears, through faltering smiles, through sweet shame and pain, the secret of your heart!"

275,"the journey the morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. we sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. we quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by. the sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. the shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and i laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. my companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. they crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. all honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. i gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation ---in the shadow of a dim delight. the repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. i forgot for what i had traveled, and i surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs. at last, when i woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, i saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. how i had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!"

280,"the lotus on the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and i knew it not. my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and i started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion. i knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart."

291,"when day is done if the day is done, if birds sing no more, if the wind has flagged tired, then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk."
292,our meeting two of us once met where the streams of life and death had stopped where time stood still.today it is so far and away now i am sailing alone my boat is rocking in the storm i now remember again how once we met at the end of the world where had descended the heaven.forgetting all we sat there side by side that day i realized what sways the blades of grass throughout the world in what delight everything shivers;in the dark how shine stars;in what great urge the breaths of life rush that day i realized when we woke up and looked at each other’s face.taking your hand in my hand i kept looking at the sky we had no words and didn’t know how our time passed that day i had realized in my heart of hearts where end the meanings of our words how music rises from the core of the universe how the pining woods blossom into flowers these we realized when both of us wept in endless pleasure.then we came to know in what fire silently burn the winds of spring why the morning sun yearns to get lost in everything why day and night the river runs to meet the sea why the lightning is hurt by its own light what game the night plays with dawn accepting defeat all these we realized when with each other we played staking our everything.- see more at: http://allpoetry.com/our-meeting#sthash.s3s6knfp.dpuf
293,"unending love i seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…in life after life, in age after age, forever.my spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,that you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,in life after life, in age after age, forever.whenever i hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,its ancient tale of being apart or together.as i stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:you become an image of what is remembered forever.you and i have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.at the heart of time, love of one for another.we have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you the love of all man’s days both past and forever:universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.the memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –and the songs of every poet past and forever."
294,"tumi sandhyar meghamala - you are a cluster of clouds - translation you are a cluster of clouds of the evening sky i have sought only you all my life it is you who fills my empty sky i have made you with the sweet fancies of my mind you are mine, you are mine o you wanderer of my boundless sky.with the blood of my heart i have beautified your feet my evening dreams are full of you i have coloured your lips with poison and honey mixing with my joys and sorrows you are mine, you are mine you have filled my lonely being.i have coloured your eyes with collyrium made of the fancies of my love you always fill the view of my spellbound eyes with my music i have dressed all your limbs you are mine, you are mine both in my life and death you fill my being.- see more at: http://allpoetry.com/tumi-sandhyar-meghamala---you-are-a-cluster-of-clouds---translation#sthash.qof52bgo.dpuf"
295,"freedom from fear is the freedom i claim for you my motherland!freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning call of the future;freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith you fasten yourself in night's stillness,mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;freedom from the anarchy of destiny whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,where movements are started through brainless wires,repeated through mindless habits,where figures wait with patience and obedience for the master of show,to be stirred into a mimicry of life."
296,"this dog every morning this dog, very attached to me,quietly keeps sitting near my seat till touching its head i recognize its company.this recognition gives it so much joy pure delight ripples through its entire body.among all dumb creatures it is the only living being that has seen the whole man beyond what is good or bad in him it has seen for his love it can sacrifice its life it can love him too for the sake of love alone for it is he who shows the way to the vast world pulsating with life.when i see its deep devotion the offer of its whole being i fail to understand by its sheer instinct what truth it has discovered in man.by its silent anxious piteous looks it cannot communicate what it understands but it has succeeded in conveying to me among the whole creation what is the true status of man."
297,"one day in spring....one day in spring, a woman came in my lonely woods,in the lovely form of the beloved.came, to give to my songs, melodies,to give to my dreams, sweetness.suddenly a wild wave broke over my heart's shores and drowned all language.to my lips no name came,she stood beneath the tree, turned,glanced at my face, made sad with pain,and with quick steps, came and sat by me.taking my hands in hers, she said:'you do not know me, nor i you—i wonder how this could be?'i said:'we two shall build, a bridge for ever between two beings, each to the other unknown,this eager wonder is at the heart of things.'the cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;the thread with which she binds me binds her too.her have i sought everywhere,her have i worshipped within me,hidden in that worship she has sought me too.crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.she forgot to return, having lost her own.her own charms play traitor to her,she spreads her net, knowing not whether she will catch or be caught."
298,"krishnakali in the village they call her the dark girl but to me she is the flower krishnakali on a cloudy day in a field i saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.she had no covering on her head,her loose hair had fallen on her back.dark? however dark she be,i have seen her dark gazelleeyes.two black cows were lowing,as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.so with anxious, hurried steps,the dark girl came from her hut.raising her eyebrows toward the sky,she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.dark? however dark she be,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.a gust of the east wind rippled the rice plants.i was standing by a ridge,alone in the field.whether or not she looked at me is known only to us two.dark? however dark she be,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.this how the kohldark cloud rises in the northeast in jaistha;the soft dark shadow descends on the tamal grove in asharh;and sudden delight floods the heart in the night of sravan.dark? however dark she be,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.to me she is the flower krishnakali,whatever she may be called by others.in a field in maynapara village i saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.she did not cover her head,not having the time to feel embarrassed.dark? however dark she be,i have seen her dark gazelle-eyes."
299,"waiting the song i came to sing remains unsung to this day. i have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. the time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart….. i have not seen his face, nor have i listened to his voice; only i have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house….. but the lamp has not been lit and i cannot ask him into my house; i live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet."
300," fireflies my fancies are fireflies, — specks of living light twinkling in the dark.he voice of wayside pansies,that do not attract the careless glance,murmurs in these desultory lines.in the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future,but for the moment's whim.joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves,and dances in the air for a day.my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.the butterfly counts not months but moments,and has time enough.my thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,carrying a single laughter.the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,and therefore you may remember them.leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden,but keep my song.april, like a child,writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers,wipes them away and forgets.memory, the priestess,kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust,god watches them play and forgets the priest.my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.in the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height;in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.the departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature,tense with an unyielding secret.sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it.wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.though he holds in his arms the earth-bride,the sky is ever immensely away.god seeks comrades and claims love,the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her,the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,unobscured by the dust of history.alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.one who was distant came near to me in the morning,and still nearer when taken away by night.white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.when peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.the lake lies low by the hill,a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.the breeze whispers to the lotus,""what is thy secret?""""it is myself,"" says the lotus,""steal it and i disappear!""the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.the jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.clouds are hills in vapour,hills are clouds in stone, —a phantasy in time's dream.while god waits for his temple to be built of love,men bring stones.i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.my heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over.i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.the one without second is emptiness,the other one makes it true.life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,and the sun says, they are good.your calumny against the great is impious,it hurts yourself;against the small it is mean,for it hurts the victim.the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades,and then the simple light-fruit,the sun appears.the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out.life's play is swift,life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.my flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.thou hast risen late, my crescent moon,but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself.the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong.the wind of heaven blows,the anchor desperately clutches the mud,and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.the spirit of death is one,the spirit of life is many,whe god is dead religion becomes one.the blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,the wind between them sighs, ""alas.""day's pain muffled by its own glare,burns among stars in the night.the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.he who does good comes to the temple gate,he who loves reaches the shrine.flower, have pity for the worm,it is not a bee,its love is a blunder and a burden.with the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.your careless gifts of a moment,like the meteors of an autumn night,catch fire in the depth of my being.the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.spring hesitates at winter's door,but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.the world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.as a river in the sea,work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.thy shy little pomegranate bud,blushing to-day behind her veil,will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when i am away.the clumsiness of power spoils the key,and uses the pickaxe.birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours,and not to reach any destination.migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.the sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.love punishes when it forgives,and injured beauty by its awful silence.you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.god is world is ever renewed by death,a titan's ever crushed by its own existence.the glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.the tree is of to-day, the flower is old,it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring.god honours me when i work,he loves me when i sing.my love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence,flowers guess the secret, and mile,while the leaves whisper.i leave no trace of wings in the air,but i am glad i have had my flight.the fireflies, twinkling among leaves,make the stars wonder.the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.while the rose said to the sun,""i shall ever remember thee,""her petals fell to the dust.hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.though the thorn in thy flower pricked me,o beauty,i am grateful.the world knows that the few are more than the many.let not my love be a burden on you, my friend,know that it pays itself.dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.the dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.in the thrill of little leaves i see the air's invisible dance,and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.you are like a flowering tree,amazed when i praise you for your gifts.the earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees,scattering sparks in flowers.foretsts, the clouds of earth,hold up to the sky their silence,and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.the world speaks to me in pictures,my soul answers in music.the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.the darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.pride engraves his frowns in stones,loe offers her surrender in flowers.the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.the hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea,and laughs and bursts into emptiness.love is an endless mystery,for it has nothing else to explain its.my clouds, sorrowing in the dark,forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him.you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.i came to offer thee a flower,but thou must have all my garden,—it is thine.the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.it is easy to make faces at the sun,he is exposed by his own light in all directions.history slowly smothers its truth,but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.my work is rewarded in daily wages,i wait for my final value in love.beauty knows to say, ""enough,""barbarism clamours for still more.god loves to see in me, not his servant,but himself who serves all.the darkness of night is in harmony with day,the morning of mist is discordant.in the bounteous time of roses love is wine,—it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet:""are we not of the same soil, my lover?""i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him.my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.the clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.the shade of my tree is for passers-by,its fruit for the one for whom i wait.flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.the reed waits for his master's breath,the master goes seeking for his reed.to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,its writing unmeaning.the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.the greed for fruit misses the flower.god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.the sky sets no snare to capture the moon,it is her own freedom which binds her.the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.wealth is the burden of bigness,welfare the fulness of being.the razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,not the bee busily storing honey.child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water,the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.the mist weaves her net round the morning,captivates him, and makes him blind.the morning star whispers to dawn,""tell me that you are only for me.""""yes,"" she answers,""and also only for that nameless flower.""the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,is simple and inexplicable.death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.truth loves its limits,for there it meets the beautiful.between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self,which i long to cross.the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.the wise know how to teach,the fool how to smite.the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.the captive flower in the king's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.its store of snow is the hill's own burden,its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.to carry the burden of the insturment,count the cost of its material,and never to know that it is for music,is the tragedy of deaf life.faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.i bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.the mountain fir, in its rustling,modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious,he ignored me when i was languid.the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.let my love find its strength in the service of day,its peace in the union of night.life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light.the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.open thy door to that which must go,for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.true end is not in the reaching of the limit,but in a completion which is limitless.the shore whispers to the sea:""write to me what thy waves struggle to say.""the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,matured in joy and sorrow,will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.form is in matter, rhythm in force,meaning in the person.there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,i seek thy company so that i may sing.as the tree its leaves, i shed my words on the earth,let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.my faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,help thee, master, in thy creation.all the delights that i have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast,in a perfect union of love.some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth,and they are great;i have listened to catch the music of thy play,and i am glad.the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed,pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,the grass its service to the earth.the sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.the flame met the earthen lamp in me,and what a great marvel of light!mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness.the rainbow calmly answered,""i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.""let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.my mind has itstrue union with thee, o sky,at the window which is mine own,and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.man claims god's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.the buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,is ashamed that is has lost all its song.like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground.like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours,in flowers and leaves.my life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.the tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.my soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,—a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.the sunlight opens for me the word's gate,love's light its terasure.my life like the reed with ist stops,has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.life's aspirations come in the guise of children.the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.in my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.light is young, the ancient light;shadows are of the moment, they are born old.i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see.the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine,i lose the one that is netted by me.your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play.the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns,into thoughts and reams.my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing.when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself.my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.love's gift cannot be given,it waits to be accepted.when death comes and whispers to me,""thy days are ended,""let me say to him, ""i have lived in love and not in mere time.""he will ask, ""will thy songs remain?""i shall say, ""i know not, but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity.""""let me light my lamp,""say the star,'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.""before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all,leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change."
301,"on the nature of love the night is black and the forest has no end;a million people thread it in a million ways.we have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where or with whom - of that we are unaware.but we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips.scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:whomever i see that instant i fall in love with.i call that person and cry: `this life is blest!for your sake such miles have i traversed!'all those others who came close and moved off in the darkness - i don't know if they exist or not."
302,"the kiss lips' language to lips' ears.two drinking each other's heart, it seems.two roving loves who have left home,pilgrims to the confluence of lips.two waves rise by the law of love to break and die on two sets of lips.two wild desires craving each other meet at last at the body's limits.love's writing a song in dainty letters,layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.plucking flowers from two sets of lips perhaps to thread them into a chain later.this sweet union of lips is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles."
303,the sun of the first day the sun of the first day put the question to the new manifestation of life-who are you?there was no answer.years passed by.the last sun of the last day uttered the question on the shore of the western sea in the hush of evening-who are you?no answer came again.
304,"lord of my life thou who art the innermost spirit of my being,art thou pleased, lord of my life?for i give to thee my cup filled with all the pain and delight that the crushed grapes of my heart had surrendered,i wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,and with the molten gold of my desires i fashioned playthings for thy passing hours.i know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,lord of my life.didst thou store my days and nights,my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?i see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,lord of my life,i wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven.for many were my days without service and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers that faded in the shade not offered to thee.often the tied strings of my lute slackened at the strains of thy tunes.and often at the ruin of wasted hours my desolate evenings were filled with tears.but have my days come to their end at last,lord of my life, while my arms round thee grow limp, my kisses losing their truth?then break up the meeting of this languid day!renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;and let the wedding come once again in a new ceremony of life."
305,keep me fully glad ii        keep me fully glad with nothing. only take my hand in your hand.        in the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. bind me close to you with nothing.        i will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. under this clouded sky i will meet silence with silence. i will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.        make my life glad with nothing.        the rains sweep the sky from end to end. jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. the cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.

307,"broken song kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound:the seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds.his voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere,it darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when.he sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away:the courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise.only the old king pratap ray sits like wood, unmoved.haraj lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold.from childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing -rag kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains,songs for durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell -his heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears.and on days when friends gathered and filled the hall there were cowherds' songs of krsna, in raags bhupali and multan.so many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house:servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight:the bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels,young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear:before him, singing raag sahana, sits baraj lal.the king's heart is full of all those days and songs.when he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside,no sudden magical awakening of memories of the past.when pratap ray watches kasinath he just sees his wagging head:tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart.kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space.pratap ray smilingly turns his eyes to baraj lal.he puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'dear ustad,give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all.it's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird.we used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'old baraj lal, white-haired, white turban on his head,bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat.he takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand and with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag yaman-kalyap.his quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall,is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries.pratap ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again:'superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'the courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves,some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms;some of them call to servants, 'bring the bookah, bring some pan.'some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat.they cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about -the hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown.the old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon:only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone.the song and baraj lal's feelings go separate ways,but he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king.one of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind.he quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time.again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame;he starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop.his hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name.his voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze.he abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune,but suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries.the intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away -tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls.in shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap -he has failed to remember a song:  he weeps as he did as a child.with brimming eyes king pratap ray tenderly touches his friend:'come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love.they leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights.the two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands.baraj says with hands clasped, 'master, our days are gone.new men have come now, new styles and customs in the world.the court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left.don't ask anyone to listen to me now, i beg you at your feet, my lord.the singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears:one man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind.only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound;only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world.where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'"

310,"at the last watch pity, in place of love,    that pettiest of gifts,is but a sugar-coating over neglect.    any passerby can make a gift of it        to a street beggar,only to forget the moment the first corner is turned.        i had not hoped for anything more that day.you left during the last watch of night.    i had hoped you would say goodbye,          just say 'adieu' before going away,    what you had said another day,              what i shall never hear again.                in their place, just that one word,bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion          would even that have been too much for you to bear?          when i first awoke from sleep                    my heart fluttered with fear            lest the time had been over.              i rushed out of bed.      the distant church clock chimed half past twelve              i sat waiting near the door of my room                  resting my head against it,    facing the porch through which you would come out.even that tiniest of chances  was snatched away by fate from hapless me;  i fell asleep        shortly before you left.perhaps you cast a sidelong glance            at my reclining body    like a broken boat left high and dry.  perhaps you walked away with care            lest you wake me up.  awaking with a start i knew at once            that my vigil had been wasted  i realised, what was to go went away in a moment,        what was to stay behind stayed on            for all time.silence everywhere  like that of a birds' nest bereft of birds        on the bough of a songless tree.with the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended        the pallor of dawn  spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life.                  i walked towards your bedroom                                    for no reason.                      outside the door              burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot,            the porch smelt of the smouldering wick.over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolled-up mosquito-net                    fluttered a little in the breeze.            seen in the sky outside through the window                        was the morning star,                    witness of all sleepless people                        bereft of hope.suddenly i found you had left behind by mistake your gold-mounted ivory walking stick.      if there were time, i thought,      you might come back from the station to look for it,      but not because  you had not seen me before going away."

391,"you can be whatever you want to be! there is inside you all of the potential to be whatever you want to be,all of the energy to do whatever you want to do.imagine yourself as you would like to be,doing what you want to do,and each day, take one step towards your dream.and though at times it may seem too difficult to continue,hold on to your dream.one morning you will awake to find that you are the person you dreamed of,doing what you wanted to do,simply because you had the courage to believe in your potential and to hold on to your dream."
392,"within you is the strength to meet life's challenges! you are stronger than you think,remember to stand tall.every challenge in your life helps you to grow.every problem you encounter strengthens your mind and your soul.every trouble you overcome increases your understanding of life.when all your troubles weigh heavily on your shoulders,remember that beneath the burden you can stand tall,because you are never given more than you can handle...and you are stronger than you think."
393,"words to live by it's not how much you accomplish in life that really counts,but how much you give to other.it's not how high you build your dreams that makes a difference,but how high your faith can climb.it's not how many goals you reach,but how many lives you touch.it's not who you know that matters,but who you are inside.believe in the impossible,hold tight to the incredible,and live each day to its fullest potential.you can make a difference in your world."
394,"a creed to live by don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others.it is because we are different that each of us is special.don't set your goals by what other people deem important.only you know what is best for you.don't take for granted the things closest to your heart.cling to them as you would your life, for without them life is meaningless.don't let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future.by living your life one day at a time,you live all the days of your life.don't give up when you still have something to give.nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect.it is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.don't be afraid to encounter risks.it is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find.the quickest way to receive love is to give love.the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly;and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.don't dismiss your dreams.to be without dreams is to be without hope;to be without hope is to be without purpose.don't run through life so fast that you forget not only where you've been, but also where you're going.life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way."
395,"don't give up! your dreams may be closer than you think! there may be times when you feel as if you have taken a million steps towards your dreams, and acted on your plans, only to find yourself in the same place that you began from.at times like this, you must not give up. you must continue on. though you may feel lost, bewildered, and alone, continue to believe in yourself. do not allow discouragement and doubt to blur your vision and wash away your dreams. visualize your way beyond the detours, standstills, and obstacles.you will realize your dreams. you have worked hard and taken so many productive steps in a positive direction that you are bound to succeed. whatever the hurt of the moment may be, it will pass. tomorrow is always a new dawn. today, you must pause, rest, catch your breath, and then look ahead. each step will bring you closer to your dreams. the rainbows and the love that you deserve are in sight. happiness is just around the next turn. "
396,"you can do anything you believe you can just start somewhere. resolve to do something.you might even write out what you want to accomplish. then explore what you need to do to reach you goal, and start doing it, step by step.it's the same as if you were planning a trip: you get a map, make your preparations, and then start traveling the right road. don't get ""bound up"" in any problems that stand in your way. do something every day to resolve them. trust your instincts. do one thing at a time.remember... i f you sow seeds of fear, doubt, panic,and procrastination, it will most likely work against you. if you keep doing the same things you're doing now, you will keep ending up in similar places to where you are now.once you start making progress towards your goal,you will be magically propelled towards eventual reward. just keep listening and taking direction from inside you. be patient; your dreams will not come true overnight. but start now, and go with love and courage and confidence. don't be afraid.you can do anything you believe you can. and don't forget to keep an open mind and heart to check yourself along the way. you can do it! go for it, and good luck.

"
402,"reaching your dream takes courage courage is admitting that you're afraid and facing that fear directly. it's being strong enough to ask for help and humble enough to accept it. courage is standing up for what you believe in without worrying about the opinions of others. it's following your own heart, living your own life, and settling for nothing less than the best for yourself. courage is daring to take a first step, a big leap, or a different path. it's attempting to do something that no one has done before and all others thought impossible. courage is keeping heart in the face of disappointment and looking at defeat not as an end but as a new beginning. it's believing that things will ultimately get better even as they get worse. courage is being responsible for your own actions and admitting your own mistakes without placing blame on others. it's relying not on others for your success, but on your own skills and efforts. courage is refusing to quit even when you're intimidated by impossibility. it's choosing a goal, sticking with it, and finding solutions to the problems. courage is thinking big, aiming high, and shooting far. it's taking a dream and doing anything, risking everything, and stopping at nothing to it make it a reality. "
403,"today's dreams are tomorrow's successes don't be afraid of high hopes or plans that seem to be out of reach.life is meant to be experienced,and every situation allows for learning and growth. motivation is a positive starting point,and action places you on a forward path.a dream is a blueprint of a goal not yet achieved;the only difference between the two is the effort involved in attaining what you hope to accomplish. let your mind and heart urge you on;allow the power of your will to lead you to your destination. don't count the steps ahead;just add up the total of steps already covered,and multiply it by faith, confidence, and endurance. always remember that for those who persist,today's dreams are transformed into tomorrow's successes. "
404,believe in yourself and your dreams will come true know what you can and want to do in life. set goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them. strive to have fun every day. use your creativity as a means of expressing your feelings. be sensitive in viewing the world. develop a sense of confidence. be honest with yourself and with others. follow your heart and adhere to your own truths. know that the more you give the more you will receive. believe in yourself and your dreams will come true. 
405,"take these thoughts with you on your journey to your dreams don't ever forget that you are unique. be your best self and not an imitation of someone else. find your strength and use them in a positive way. don't listen to those who ridicule the choices you make. travel the road that you have chosen and don't look back with regret. you have to take chances to make your dreams happen. remember that there is plenty of time to travel another road - and still another - in your journey through life. take the time to find the route that is right for you. you will learn something valuable from every trip you take, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. tell yourself that you're okay just the way you are. make friends who respect your true self. take the time to be alone, too, so you can know just how terrific your own company can be. remember that being alone doesn't always mean being lonely; it can be a beautiful experience of finding your creativity, your heartfelt feelings, and the calm and quiet peace deep inside you. don't ever forget that you are special and you have within you the ability to make your dreams come true.

406,"go after your dreams you're good, but you're going to be great. you're the best, but you're going to get better. sometimes the paths we take are long and hard, but remember: those are always the ones that lead to the most beautiful views. challenges come along inevitably: how you respond to them determines who you are - deep down inside - and everything you're going to be. increase the chances of reaching your goals by working at them gradually. the very best you can do is all that is asked of you. realize that you are capable of working miracles of your own making. remember that opportunities have a reason for knocking on your door, and the right ones are there for the taking. you don't always have to win, but you do need to know what it takes to be a winner. it's up to you to find the key that unlocks the door to a more fulfilling life. understand that increased difficulty brings you nearer to the truth of how to survive it - and get beyond it. cross your bridges. meet your challenges. reach out for your dreams, and bring them closer and closer to your heart. get rid of the ""if only's"" and get on with whatever you need to do to get things right. go after what you want in life, with all the blessings of all the people who care about you. and find out what making your wishes come true really feels like.

434,"the laughter therapy(i) every morning the ritual is the same, - i say my prayers and take his name; as i settle down to read the papers, –about our politician’s famous ‘blame game’! it is then i always hear, loud peals of laughter from our adjacent park, a man dedicated to laughter therapy, with his loud guffaw and reverberating bark! trying to resolve this laughing mystery, -i read several articles about laughter therapy! (ii) amongst all created things and living beings, man alone suffers deeply in his body, mind, and soul; with peals of laughter he must suppress his tears, to balance this life and control! yet during those rare and supreme happy moments of life, -tears are seen to well-up in our eyes! laughter gets mingled with our tears, -i wonder why? ! perhaps laughter and tears are two sides, of the same coin of our worldly life! while our lacrymal glands perform this feat, -as laughter and tears join hands to make this life complete! (iii) while hearty, non-ridiculing and connecting laughter does provide, physiological, psychological and spiritual benefits - on hindsight! laughter brings a twinkle in our eyes, destroying our conservative reputation; improving our cardiovascular flexibility, increasing our spiritual quotient! laughter like internal jogging, gives us an internal massaging; performed both silently and rapidly beyond imagining! revitalizing those unexplored internal crannies – all automatic! far better than all our know antibiotics! laughter a tranquilizer without side effects, releases our pent-up tension relaxing us instead! (iv) an optimist always laughs to forget, while a pessimist forgets to laugh, my man in the park is perhaps an optimist, who has embraced this therapy as an art! or perhaps that man laughs daily at the frailties of a meaningless life, in this life of absurdities as he adapts himself to survive! this laughter therapy is a tranquilizer both healthy and free, perhaps that man in the park is laughing at both you and me! our life becomes a tragedy for those who only feel! but a comedy of laughter, if you pause a while to think! so let us try to make others laugh while we try to control our tears, laughing is a healing process and drives away our fears! let us make a new year’s resolution, making laughter our altruistic mission; coupled with a loving and caring heart all true, -let this laughter as a therapy - benefit both me and you!

509,"the house with nobody in it a poem by joyce kilmer whenever i walk to suffern along the erie track i go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.i suppose i've passed it a hundred times, but i always stop for a minute and look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. i never have seen a haunted house, but i hear there are such things;that they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.i know this house isn't haunted, and i wish it were, i do;for it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. this house on the road to suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,and somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.it needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;but what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. if i had a lot of money and all my debts were paid i'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.i'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be and i'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.but there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone for the lack of something within it that it has never known. but a house that has done what a house should do,a house that has sheltered life,that has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,a house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. so whenever i go to suffern along the erie track i never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,for i can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart"
510,"darkness - a poem by lord byron i had a dream, which was not all a dream.the bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;morn came, and went and came, and brought no day,and men forgot their passions in the dread of this desolation; and all hearts were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:and they did live by watchfires - and the thrones,the palaces of crowned kings, the huts, the habitations of all things which dwell, were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed, and men were gathered round their blazing homes to look once more into each other's face; happy were those who dwelt within the eye of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: a fearful hope was all the world contain'd; forest were set on fire but hour by hour they fell and faded and the crackling trunks extinguish'd with a crash and all was black. the brows of men by the despairing light wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits the flashes fell upon them; some lay down and hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;and others hurried to and fro, and fed their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up with mad disquietude on the dull sky, the pall of a past world; and then again with curses cast them down upon the dust, and gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd,and, terrified, did flutter on the ground, and flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes came tame and tremolous; and vipers crawl'd and twined themselves among the multitude, hissing, but stingless, they were slain for food:and war, which for a moment was no more, did glut himself again; a meal was bought with blood, and each sate sullenly apart gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; all earth was but one thought and that was death,immediate and inglorious; and the pang of famine fed upon all entrails men died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;the meagre by the meagre were devoured, even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,and he was faithful to a corpse, and kept the birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,but with a piteous and perpetual moan and a quick desolate cry, licking the hand which answered not with a caress, he died. the crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two of an enormous city did survive, and they were enemies; they met beside the dying embers of an altar-place where had been heap'd a mass of holy things for an unholy usage; they raked up, and shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands the feeble ashes, and their feeble breath blew for a little life, and made a flame wich was a mockery; then they lifted up their eyes as it grew lighter, and each other's aspects. saw, and shriek'd, and died, beheld even of their mutual hideousness they died, unknowing who he was upon whose brow famine had written fiend. the world was void,the populous and the powerful was a lump, seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless, a lump of death, a chaos of hard clay. the rivers, lakes, and ocean stood still, and nothing stirred within their silent depths; ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, and their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropp'd they slept on the abyss without a surge the waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,the moon their mistress had expired before; the winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them. she was the universe.

""why can't anything ever go my way?""you crawl out of bed. decide to give life another whirl. you reach out. some reach back. some don't even call back. just when you thought you had no more to lose.you do. these people you thought to be friends just wanted you to use.so you lay back down just wanting to snooze, thinking why me? is it how i choose?you begin to give up. you don't see a reason any longer to even wake up. then all of a sudden you hear the sound of the phone ring or a knock on the door. someone there to tell you not to give up, you're worth so much more. you begin to cry while this other person is wondering why. you try to say ""thank you for being my friend today, if it weren't for you i would’ve given up and died.""you now know the answer of ""why"".it’s to remind you to never give up and to always try. now when i cry i know and don’t ask why.i get out of bed and again i try.

588,"a different kind of hero a hero to me is not just a person who died for there country or went inside a burning building or stuff like that. a hero to me is a single mother who survives everyday by herself. a teenager against all odds getting through life. an alcoholic walking into a rehab center. a father being not just a father but a friend, a caregiver, supporter, a brick wall for his kids. a friend who no matter what or how wrong you are standing up for you and taking your side. a hero who no matter how hard they are being hit or pushed or beat down, no matter how bad they are emotionally or physically or psychologically they stand up and keep going. they push through the pain of life, love, kids, work, school, drugs, sports, parents, heartbreak, alcohol, that to me is a hero. a person who isn’t just there, but is there living, breathing, and surviving."

599,"too broken to break here’s to the girl with the invincible spirit,no matter how confused her soul may be.she’s been broken many times,searching for love that was just not there.she’s learned her lesson now, put up her wall,and never again her heart she’ll bare.for she realized that in the end a body is still a body,no matter who’s it may be,and love may not exist for anyone so we should all just settle and it’ll be easy.but she’ll never give in,all she needs is herself, and who ever she is that day,but this she’ll never know,because life is surreal when all she does is feel.she thinks with her passion,sees the world through her heart even though many times it’s cold, desolate, and dark.yet at the same time she can see that there may be hope out there,the one nobody else possibly can.she’s a dreamer and an idealist,life’s greatest pessimist and realist.she’s a contradiction sure,but never a hypocrite,because in her soul this all somehow fits.she wants to explore the world just to understand what she’s thinking,dig into the deepest corners of her heart to understand the universe.she often loses herself though,and who she used to be she can never know.yet she’s happy like this,she’s free and to no one she’ll commit,except sometimes when she’s all alone,she just wants some place she can call home.she knows every side of every story,because she has felt absolutely everything,often all at once.this contradiction,this ability to see in ways that no one else can,is it a curse or is it a gift?even she cannot understand how or when or why or what,and sometimes she doesn’t even know if it is.she wants something more,even when she is sure there’s nothing else out there.but no, she’ll never settle,especially for a love, if that even does exist.she’ll always hope there’s something out there to bring her bliss. but she doesn’t expect it and convinces herself she doesn’t want it.this is how her spirit is infinite.oh, how i hope there’s something more than this."

710,"bravado alone again, just another day dedicated to love ones missed. as i sit with an empty soul, not sad, not glad but pissed, thinking back on happier times when those who are gone hugged and kissed. but they're gone and the world still turns. i put up a bravado that i'm happy, but really my heart yearns for those better days trips to the beach and sun burns. family get-togethers laughs and smile. food collecting on our plates in piles and piles. but now all that piles up on my tears, most out of heartache but some come from fears. i could have hydrated an entire nation over the years. yet i mask them with smiles that are hollow in hope that there will always be a better tomorrow. but until then you will forever see is my bravado."

715,"the face of sadness its happened again.the moment when i thought nothing would go wrong,that everything would be alright,that there was nothing to worry about,that everything was perfect.but just like those other times,it didn't last.another moment in life,another piece to the puzzle.slowly completing,and showing its face.the face that i've been longing to see.the face i was always aware of,the face i've been waiting for,the face i'm conscious of.suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.i stare motionless,although expected, still surprised.calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,able to realize that this is what i was sent to discover.sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.not a game but another rationally humanly way of living.just another part i must adjust to.and when the end suddenly appears,ill be proud to say that i learned something in life.proud to say that i learned something thanks to you.proud to say i saw the face and learned about it.proud to say that that face was introduced by you,fed by you,and lived by you."
